=head1 About this document

This is the reference document for
the domain-specific language (DSL)
of Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF).
The SLIF's DSL is
an extension of BNF.
The SLIF DSL is used to specify other
DSL's, and is therefore a "meta-DSL".

=head1 The structure of SLIF source strings

The SLIF source string consists of a series of rules,
pseudo-rules and statements.
These are made up of tokens,
as described below.
Whitespace separates tokens, but is otherwise ignored.

A hash ("C<#>") character starts a comment,
which continues to the end of the line.
Comments are equivalent to whitespace.

=head1 G0, G1 and lexemes

In reading this document, it is important to keep in mind
the distinction, on one hand, between G0 and G1 rules and,
on the other hand, between rules and lexemes.
G1 rules have a semantics,
which can be specified as described
in this document.
G0 rules simply recognize symbols in the input.
G0 rules do not have a semantics.

Top-level G0 rules correspond to a string in the input.
The top-level G0 rules are seen by G1 as lexemes,
and the string to which a top-level G0 rule
corresponds becomes the default value of the lexeme.
The G0 grammar can be thought of as similar
in behavior to a set of regular expressions
with the lexemes being seen as similar to named captures.

Lexemes are the symbols which form the interface between
G1 and G0.  Lexemes, like G1 rules, have a semantics.
The semantics of lexemes is
specified separately from the
semantics of G1 rules,
as described below.

=head1 Symbol names

Symbol names can be either "bare" or enclosed in angle brackets.
Bare symbol names must consist entirely of Perl word characters
(alphanumerics, plus the underscore).
Symbol names are case-sensitive.

The angle brackets, if used, serve to "quote"
the symbol name,
and will not be part of the explicit symbol name.

If angle brackets are used, symbol names may also contain whitespace,
as in

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    <op comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A whitespace sequence inside angle brackets can
include any whitespace character that is legal in Perl,
including newlines.
This allows very long symbol names to be line wrapped,
if necessary.

Unlike the angle brackets,
the whitespace in a bracketed symbol token
B<does> become part of
of the explicit symbol name,
but it does so in a "normalized" form.
Leading and trailing whitespace in the name is discarded,
and all other whitespace sequences are converted to a single ASCII
space character.
This means that

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    < op comma  >
    <op   comma>
    <     op comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

and even


=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    <op
    comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

will all be regarded as the same symbol name.
The explicit form of that symbol name
is C<< <op comma> >>, except that, again, the
angle brackets are for clarity,
and are not part of the explicity name.

Explicit, reserved and internal symbol names are often
displayed between angle brackets,
regardless of whether the symbol was originally
specified in bracketed form.

There are cases in which a SLIF symbol needs to be 
referred to by name in Perl code.
In this cases, it is the symbols explicit name
that is used.

=head2 Single quoted strings

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Number bless => primary
        | '(' Expression ')' bless => paren assoc => group
       || Expression '**' Expression bless => exponentiate assoc => right
       || Expression '*' Expression bless => multiply
        | Expression '/' Expression bless => divide
       || Expression '+' Expression bless => add
        | Expression '-' Expression bless => subtract

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Single quotes can be used in prioritized
rules to indicate character strings.
The characters inside the single quote
will be matched in the input, literally and one-for-one.
Single quoted strings can contain any characters with
the exception of
single quotes and vertical whitespace.

Single quoted strings do not allow "escaped" characters.
A backslash ("C<\>") represents itself and has no effect
on the interpretation of the next character.
If a rule needs to match one of the forbidden characters
(single quote or vertical whitespace), it must use a
character class.

Single quoted strings are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a single quoted string is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

=head2 Character classes

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    <vertical space char> ~ [\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A character class in square brackets ("C<[]>")
can be used in a RHS alternative of a prioritized rule,
a quantified rule or a discard rule.
Marpa character classes may contain anything acceptable to Perl,
and follow the same escaping conventions as Perl's character classes.

Character classes are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a character class is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parsers and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

An implementation note: character classes are
interpreted by Perl, but this involves minimal overhead
when the parse is of any length.
Each character class is
passed to Perl to interpret exactly once and the result is
memoized in a C language structure for future use.

=head1 Statements

The SLIF DSL consists of a series of statements.
The statements are of three kinds, as indicated by their declarator:

=over 4

=item * G1 rules

The BNF operator ("C<::=>"),
coming between the LHS and the first RHS alternative of a rule,
indicates that the rule is
a G1 rule.

=item * G0 rules

The match operator ("C<~>"),
coming between the LHS and the first RHS alternative
of a rule,
indicates a G0 rule.

=item * Global statements

Global statements
are signified by the assignment operator ("C<=>").
The location of a statement in the DSL source
will never affect the result.

=back

Rules differ from statements in that
the effect of a rule
is sometimes lexical --
that is, the effect may vary depending
on the position of the rule in the DSL source.
Some rules are called pseudo-rules.
Pseudo-rules do not correspond to BNF rules,
but instead use the rule format as a convenient
way to express other information.

=head1 The structure of rules

Every rule declaration consists of, in order:

=over 4

=item * A left hand side (LHS).
This will be a
symbol or a pseudo-symbol.

=item * A declaration operator ("C<::=>" or "C<~>").

=item * A right side declaration, which contains one or more RHS
alternatives.
Details of the right side declaration vary by the type of rule.
For each type of rule,
the right side declaration is described in detail below.

=back

=head1 RHS alternatives

The right side declaration of a rule will often contain one or
more RHS alternatives.
A RHS alternative is a series of RHS primaries,
where a RHS primary may be a symbol name,
a character class,
or a single quoted string.
Associated with each RHS is often
list of zero or more adverbs.
Each adverb consists of a keyword,
the adverb operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the adverb's value.

Within an alternative, symbols may be enclosed in parentheses.
A symbol enclosed in parentheses is hidden from
L<Marpa's semantics|Marpa::R2::Semantics>.
A set of parentheses may contain more than one symbol,
in which case the entire sequence of symbols is hidden,
as if they had been enclosed in parentheses individually.
"Hiding" symbols in this way can be convenient for symbols whose values
the semantics will ignore, perhaps because the value is constant.

For example,
in the following rule

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    a ::= b (',' c) d action => ::first

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

there is

=over 4

=item *

A LHS, in this case the symbol "C<a>".

=item *

A declarator, "C<::=>", which indicates this is
a G1 rule.

=item *

A RHS alternative consisting of four RHS primaries.
The first RHS primary is the symbol "C<b>".
The second RHS primary is a short single-quoted string C<','>.
The third and fourth RHS primaries are symbols: "C<c>" and "C<d>".
The parentheses around the second and third RHS primaries "hide"
them from the semantics.
Marpa's semantics will see this as a rule with only two RHS values.

=item *

The adverb list associated with the RHS alternative,
consisting of a single adverb.
The adverb consists of its keyword "C<action>",
followed by the adverb operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the adverb's value "C<::first>".

=back

The rule in the above example is one of a very common type:
a trivial prioritized rule.
A prioritized rule is one that contains one or more prioritized RHS alternatives.
Prioritized rules are the only rules which may contain more than one RHS
alternative, but even prioritized rules usually have only one RHS alternative.
If there is only one RHS alternative, as in this case, the prioritization
is B<trivial> --
there is only one priority.

=head2 Start rule

Every source string should have a start rule.
The LHS of this rule is the C<:start> pseudo-symbol.
Only one RHS alternative is allowed.
This RHS alternative must contain only one symbol name,
No adverbs should be associated with the RHS alternative.
Start rules must be G1 rules.

=head2 Empty rules

An empty rule is a rule with an empty RHS.
The empty RHS, technically, is a RHS alternative, one with zero RHS primaries.
The C<action> and
C<bless> adverbs are allowed 
for the empty RHS alternative,
but no others.
A empty rule makes its LHS symbol a nullable symbol.

=head2 Quantified rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Script ::= Expression+ separator => comma

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A quantified rule has only one RHS alternative,
which is followed by a quantifier.
The RHS alternative must consist of a single RHS primary.
This RHS primary must be a symbol name or a character class.
The quantifer is either
a star ("C<*>"),
or a plus sign ("C<+>")
indicating, respectively, that the sequence rule has a minimum length
of 0 or 1.

Adverbs may be associated with the RHS alternative.
The adverb list must follow the quantifier.
The adverbs allowed are C<action>,
C<bless>,
C<proper> and
C<separator>.

=head2 Prioritized rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Number bless => primary
        | '(' Expression ')' bless => paren assoc => group
       || Expression '**' Expression bless => exponentiate assoc => right
       || Expression '*' Expression bless => multiply
        | Expression '/' Expression bless => divide
       || Expression '+' Expression bless => add
        | Expression '-' Expression bless => subtract

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A prioritized rule contains a series of one or more RHS alternatives,
separated by either the alternation operator ("C<|>")
or the loosen operators ("C<||>").
In a typical grammar, most rules are prioritized rules,
but they are often trivially prioritized,
consisting of only one RHS alternative.
For brevity, RHS alternatives are often called B<alternatives>.

Each alternative may be followed by a list of associated adverbs.
The 
C<action>,
C<assoc> and
C<bless> adverbs are allowed.

The RHS alternatives in a prioritized right hand side proceed
from tightest (highest) priority to loosest.
The double "or" symbol ("C<||>") is the "loosen" operator --
the alternatives after it
have a looser (lower) priority than the alternatives before it.
The single "or" symbol ("C<|>") is the ordinary "alternative" operator --
alternatives on each side of it have the same priority.
Associativity is specified using adverbs, as described below.

=head2 Discard rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :discard ~ whitespace

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A discard rule is a rule whose LHS is
the C<:discard> pseudo-symbol,
and which has only one RHS alternative.
The RHS alternative must contain
exactly one symbol name,
called the B<discarded symbol>.
Discard rules indicate that the discarded symbol is a top-level G0
symbol, but one which is not a lexeme.
When a discarded symbol is recognized,
it is not passed as a lexeme to the G1 parser, but is
(as the name suggests) discarded.
Discard rules must be G0 rules.
No adverbs are allowed.

=head2 Default pseudo-rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :default ::= action => [values] bless => ::lhs

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The purpose of
the default pseudo-rule is to change the defaults for
rule adverbs.
Technically, it has one RHS alternative, but this must always contain
zero RHS primaries.
Default pseudo-rules do not affect the defaults for G0 rules
or for lexemes.
There may be more than one default pseudo-rule.
The scope of default pseudo-rules is lexical, applying only to rules
that appear afterwards in the DSL source.

Currently only the C<action> and C<bless> adverbs
can be specified in a default pseudo-rule.
Each default pseudo-rule creates a completely new
set of defaults -- if an adverb is not specified,
the default is reset to its implicit value,
the value which it had prior to any explicit settings.

=head2 Lexeme pseudo-rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF lexeme rule synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <say keyword> priority => 1

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The purpose of
the C<:lexeme> pseudo-rule is to allow adverbs to
change the treatment of a lexeme.
This pseudo-rule always had exactly one RHS alternative,
and that RHS alternative must contain exactly one symbol.
This RHS symbol identifies the lexeme which the adverbs will affect.
The only adverbs allowed in a C<:lexeme> rule
are
L<C<event>|/"event">,
L<C<pause>|/"pause">,
and
L<C<priority>|/"priority">.

As a side effect, a C<:lexeme> pseudo-rule
declares that its RHS symbol is a lexeme.
This declaration does not "force" lexeme status --
if the symbol does not meet the criteria for a lexeme
based on its use in G0 and G1 rules,
the result will be a fatal error.
Applications may find the ability to "declare"
lexemes useful for debugging,
and for documenting grammars.

=head2 Lexeme default statement

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    lexeme default = action => [start,length,value] bless => ::name

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The lexeme default statement changes the defaults for
lexeme adverbs.
It only changes the defaults for lexemes,
and does not affect rules.
Only the defaults for
the C<action> and C<bless> adverbs
can be specified in a lexeme default statement.
Only one lexeme default statement is allowed in a file.

=head2 Named event statement

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF completed event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event subtext = completed <subtext>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF nulled event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event 'A[]' = nulled <A>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF predicted event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event '^a' = predicted A

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The named event statement sets up a symbol
so that a named event is triggered
when some condition occurs at a location.
Named events
can be defined to occur when
a symbol is predicted,
when a symbol is completed,
or 
when a symbol is nulled.

A "completed" event
occurs whenever a rule with that symbol on
its LHS is fully recognized in the parse.
(The idea is that "symbol completion" occurs when the
rule, and therefore its LHS, is "complete".)
For the purpose of "completed" events,
a nulled symbol is not considered "complete",
and "completed" events will not be triggered
for a zero-length instance of a symbol.

A "nulled" event occurs whenever a zero-length symbol instance
is recognized.
Null symbols may derive other null symbols,
and these derivations may be ambiguous.
Ambiguous or not,
all such derivations cause "nulled" events.
Again, nulled events and completed events are mutually
exclusive -- a nulled, or zero-length, symbol is not considered
"complete" for this purpose.

A "predicted" event occurs at any location where a non-zero length
symbol would be accepted by the recognizer.
It can be thought of as occurring when a symbol is "expected".
The expectation may or may not come true, depending on future
input.
Because there is no physical distinction between expecting
a zero-length symbol,
and actually seeing one,
"predicted" events are not generated for symbols which
are only expected in zero-length form.

Completed and nulled events may not be defined
for symbols that are lexemes, but lexemes are allowed to be predicted
events.
A predicted event which is a lexeme is different from a lexeme pause.
The lexeme pause will not occur unless that the lexeme is actually
found in the input.
A predicted event, on the other hand, is
as the name suggests, only a prediction.
The predicted symbol may or not actually be found in the input.

The name of an event may be either a bare name,
or enclosed in single quotes.
A bare event name must be one or more word characters,
starting with an alphabetic character.
A single quoted event name may contain any character
except a single quote or vertical space.
The whitespace in single quoted event names is normalized
in similar fashion to the normalization of symbol names --
leading and trailing whitespace is removed,
and all sequences of internal whitespace are changed to
a single ASCII space character.
Names containing single quotes (which, in any case,
are impossible to add using
current syntax) are reserved.

Named completion events can occur during the
L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">,
L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()">,
L<lexeme_complete()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()">,
and L<lexeme_read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()">
methods.
When they occur
in L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">,
and L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()"> methods,
they pause internal scanning.
Named events may be queried using
L<the Scanless recognizer's event()
method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"event()">.

=head1 Adverbs

Adverbs consist of a keyword, the adverb operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the adverb's value.
The keyword must be one of those described in this section.
The adverb's value must be as described for each keyword.

=head2 action

The C<action> adverb is allowed for

=over 4

=item *

An RHS alternative, in which the action is for the alternative.

=item *

The default pseudo-rule, in which case the action is for all rules which do not
have their own action explicitly specified.

=item *

The lexeme default statement, in which case the action is for all lexemes.

=back

The C<action> adverb is not allowed for G0 rules.
The possible values of actions are described,
along with other details of the semantics
L<a separate document|Marpa::R2::Semantics>.

=head2 assoc

The C<assoc> adverb is only valid in a prioritized rule.
Its value must be one of
C<left>,
C<right> or
C<group>.
Its effect will be as described
L<below|/"Precedence">.

=head2 bless

The C<bless> adverb causes the result of the semantics to be
blessed into the class indicated by the value of the adverb.
Details of its use may be found in
L<the semantics
document|Marpa::R2::Semantics/"Blessings">.

=head2 event

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF named lexeme event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <a> pause => before event => 'before a'
    :lexeme ~ <b> pause => after event => 'after b'
    :lexeme ~ <c> pause => before event => 'before c'
    :lexeme ~ <d> pause => after event => 'after d'

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<event> adverb applies only to lexemes.
It turns a lexeme's pause into a named event,
using the name specified as its value.
Applications are encouraged to turn all lexeme
pause's into named events,
using the C<event> adverb.
The allowed event names are as described
for the L<named event statement|"Named event statement">.

It is a fatal error to specify the C<event> adverb
if the C<pause> adverb is not also specified.

=head2 null-ranking

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: null-ranking adverb example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    S ::= A A A A null-ranking => high

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<null-ranking> adverb applies only to rules.
and is ignored unless
the SLIF recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
Some rule alternatives can match the same input in several ways,
depending on which symbols are nulled.
These different ways of nulling symbols in a rule
are called its null variants.
The C<null-ranking> named argument allows the application
to control the order in which null variants
are returned by the C<value()> method.

If C<null-ranking> is undefined,
the order of the null variants will be arbitrary.
This is the default,
and is acceptable to most applications.
For details on using the
C<null-ranking> adverb,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::R2::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 pause

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF named lexeme event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <a> pause => before event => 'before a'
    :lexeme ~ <b> pause => after event => 'after b'
    :lexeme ~ <c> pause => before event => 'before c'
    :lexeme ~ <d> pause => after event => 'after d'

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<pause> adverb applies only to lexemes.
Pauses take effect during
L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">
and L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()"> methods.
They cause internal scanning
to be suspended, or "paused", before
or after the specified lexeme.
Internal scanning can be resumed with
L<the Scanless recognizer's resume()
method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()">.

Applications are encouraged to name every lexeme pause
using the L<event adverb|/"event">.
If this is done, lexeme pauses can be queried using the
SLIF recognizer's
L<events() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"events()">.
Unnamed lexeme pauses must be queried using the
SLIF recognizer's
L<pause_lexeme() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"pause_lexeme()">.

If the value of pause is C<before>,
Marpa will "pause" internal scanning before
that lexeme.
No lexemes will be read at that position.

If the value of pause is C<after>,
all appicable lexemes at that position will
be read by G1,
and internal scanning will pause immediately
afterwards.

A lexeme pause event does not occur, and has no effect, if

=over 4

=item *

It is deactivated.  Deactivation and reactivation of events is
done with the SLIF recognizer's
L<activate() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"activate()">

=item *

The G1 grammar would reject that lexeme at that location.

=item *

It has
a lexeme priority lower than
the highest lexeme priority.

=item *

At the same priority,
it has a pause value of C<after>,
when another lexeme pause occurs
which has a 
pause value of C<before>.
In other words, pausing before a lexeme prevents Marpa
from pausing
after another lexeme at the same location.

=back

Even with the above restrictions,
there can be more than one lexeme pause event at a location.
The
L<pause_lexeme() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"pause_lexeme()">
will return only one of them, chosen arbitrarily, whereas
the 
L<events() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"events()">
will return all of the named events.
This is one of the reasons that applications
are strongly encouraged to specify a name for every lexeme pause event
using the C<event> adverb.

=head2 priority

The C<priority> adverb is only allowed in
L<a C<:lexeme>
pseudo-rule|/"Lexeme pseudo-rule">.
It sets the lexeme priority for the lexeme.
The priority must be an integer,
but it may be negative.
An increase in numerical value means a higher priority.
For example,
a priority of 1 is greater than a priority of 0.
A priority of 0, in turn, is greater than a priority of -1.
The default priority is zero.

Where more than one lexeme can be accepted at
a location, the lexeme priority limits the lexemes
that will be considered.
Only lexemes with the highest priority are considered.
If several lexemes have the same priority,
all of them will be accepted.

The only effect of the lexeme priority
is on the choice
of lexemes when

=over 4

=item * all of them would be accepted;

=item * all started at the same string location;

=item * all end at the same string location; and therefore

=item * all have the same length.

=back

Lexeme priorities only have
an effect when lexemes are accepted.
The intent of this scheme is to avoid situations where a lexeme
with a high priority is rejected, and causes a parse to fail,
even though another lower priority lexeme is acceptable
and would allow the parse to continue.

For example, suppose that "C<say>" can be both
a keyword (C<< <say keyword> >>),
and a variable name (C<< <variable> >>).
Suppose further that
the grammar specifies that C<< <say keyword> >> has a priority of 1,
and C<< <variable> >> is left at the default priority of 0.
When G0 finds a occurrence of "C<say>",
where both the C<say> keyword and a variable name would
be accepted by G1, then only the C<say> keyword is read by G1,
because of the priorities.

But, suppose instead that the parse is at a location
where G1 is not accepting
the C<< <say keyword> >>.
Since only lexeme priorites of acceptable lexemes are considered,
C<< <variable> >> lexeme
has the highest priority,
and the literal string "C<say>" will be read as a
C<< <variable> >>
token.

=head2 proper

The C<proper> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a boolean,
in the form of a binary digit (C<0> or C<1>).
It is only relevant is a separator
is defined and is 1 if proper separation
is required, and 0 if Perl separation is allowed.
"Perl separation" allows a final separator.
"Proper separation" is so called, because it requires
that separators be "proper" in the sense that they
must actually separating
sequence items.

=head2 rank

C<rank> is ignored unless
the recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
The range allowed for C<rank> is implementation-defined,
but numbers in the range
between -134,217,727 and 134,217,727
will always be allowed.
C<rank> is 0 by default.
For details on using the
C<rank> named argument,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::R2::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 separator

The C<separator> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a symbol of the grammar.
If specified, that symbol must separate items of the sequence.
A separator symbol may not be nullable.

=head1 Precedence

Marpa's precedence is a generalization beyond the traditional ideas of precedence.
Traditional precedence parsing required
the classification of operators as postfix, infix, etc.
Marpa's precedence parsing is NOT based on
the special treatment of operators.

For the purpose of precedence,
an operand is an occurrence in a RHS alternative
of the LHS symbol.
An operator is considered to be anything 
that is not an operand.
The arity of an alternative is the number of operands that
it contains.
All arities are allowed, from zero to the arbitrary
number imposed by system limits such as memory and file size.

For example, in the synopsis, the LHS symbol is
C<Expression>.  The alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

        (<op lparen>) Expression (<op rparen>)

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

contains one occurrence of C<Expression> and therefore has an arity of one.
The C<< <op lparen> >> and C<< <op rparen> >> are considered operators.

In the RHS alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

       Expression (<op pow>) Expression

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

C<Expression> occurs twice, and therefore the arity is 2.
C<< <op pow> >> is considered to be an operator.

Because for this purpose an operator is defined as anything that
is not an operand, Marpa treats some symbols as operators
that would not be considered operators in the traditional approach.
For example,
in the RHS alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

       Number

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

there are no occurrences of C<Expression>, so that the alternative
has an arity of zero -- it is nullary.
The symbol C<Number> is considered to be an operator.

An alternative with arity 0 is nullary.
Precedence and associativity
are meaningless in this
case and will be ignored.

An alternative with arity 1 is unary.
Precedence will have effect,
but left and right associativity will not.

An alternative with arity 2 is binary.
Precedence will have effect,
and left and right associativity will behave
in the traditional way,
The traditional behavior for binary alternatives
is exactly as described next for the I<N>-ary case.

An alternative with an arity of I<N>,
where I<N> is 2 or greater, is I<N>-ary.
Precedence will have effect.
For left associativity,
only the leftmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- operands
after the first will have the
next-tightest priority level.
For right associativity,
only the rightmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- all operands
except the last
will have the next-tightest priority level.

Marpa also allows "group" associativity.
In "group" associativity, all operands associate
at the loosest (lowest) priority.
That is, in an alternative with group associativity,
each operand may be a full expression of the kind
defined by the prioritized rule.
"Group" associativity is used, for example,
in implementing the traditional function of parentheses
in Marpa.
Group associativity is meaningless for nullary alternatives,
and is ignored.

=head2 Precedence and ambiguous grammars

Marpa's generalization of precedence works
for all grammars that
can be defined by prioritized rules.
It is efficient (linear) for all grammars that could be
parsed by the traditional precedence parsing methods.
Marpa also allows you to define alternatives
not allowed by traditional methods.
Many of these are useful,
and most of the useful ones can be parsed efficiently.

Because of the many forms of recursion allowed,
it is possible
to define highly ambiguous grammars using the precedence mechanism.
This can occur even by accident.

The user should especially be careful with
right hand side alternatives in
which all the symbols are operands.
These can be useful.
For example, an implicit operation can be defined using
an binary alternative with no non-operands,
and this could implement, for example,
the standard notation for concatenation or multiplication.
But to do this efficiently
requires either avoiding ambiguity,
or controlling its use carefully.

Marpa does catch the case where an alternative consists
only of a single operand -- a "unit rule".
This causes a fatal error.
Unit rules are easy to define by accident in
the SLIF.
The author knows of no practical use for them,
and their presence in a grammar is usually
unintentional.
Note that, in the event an application
does find a use for a grammar with unit rules,
the NAIF and the Thin interface
can parse it.
