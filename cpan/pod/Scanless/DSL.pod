=head1 About this document

This is the reference document for
the domain-specific language (DSL)
of Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF).
The SLIF's DSL is
an extension of BNF.
The SLIF DSL is used to specify other
DSL's, and is therefore a "meta-DSL".

=head1 The structure of SLIF source strings

The SLIF source string consists of a series of rules,
pseudo-rules and statements.
These are made up of tokens,
as described below.
Whitespace separates tokens, but is otherwise ignored.

A hash ("C<#>") character starts a comment,
which continues to the end of the line.
Comments are equivalent to whitespace.

=head1 G0, G1 and lexemes

In reading this document, it is important to keep in mind
the distinction, on one hand, between G0 and G1 rules and,
on the other hand, between rules and lexemes.
G1 rules have a semantics,
which can be specified as described
in this document.
G0 rules simply recognize symbols in the input.
G0 rules do not have a semantics.

Top-level G0 rules correspond to a string in the input.
The top-level G0 rules are seen by G1 as lexemes,
and the string to which a top-level G0 rule
corresponds becomes the default value of the lexeme.
The G0 grammar can be thought of as similar
in behavior to a set of regular expressions
with the lexemes being seen as similar to named captures.

Lexemes are the symbols which form the interface between
G1 and G0.  Lexemes, like G1 rules, have a semantics.
The semantics of lexemes is
specified separately from the
semantics of G1 rules,
as described below.

=head1 Symbol names

Symbol names can be either "bare" or enclosed in angle brackets.
Bare symbol names must consist entirely of Perl word characters
(alphanumerics, plus the underscore).
Symbol names are case-sensitive.

The angle brackets, if used, serve to "quote"
the symbol name,
and will not be part of the explicit symbol name.

If angle brackets are used, symbol names may also contain whitespace,
as in

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    <op comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A whitespace sequence inside angle brackets can
include any whitespace character that is legal in Perl,
including newlines.
This allows very long symbol names to be line wrapped,
if necessary.

Unlike the angle brackets,
the whitespace in a bracketed symbol token
B<does> become part of
of the explicit symbol name,
but it does so in a "normalized" form.
Leading and trailing whitespace in the name is discarded,
and all other whitespace sequences are converted to a single ASCII
space character.
This means that

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    < op comma  >
    <op   comma>
    <     op comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

and even


=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    <op
    comma>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

will all be regarded as the same symbol name.
The explicit form of that symbol name
is C<< <op comma> >>, except that, again, the
angle brackets are for clarity,
and are not part of the explicity name.

Explicit, reserved and internal symbol names are often
displayed between angle brackets,
regardless of whether the symbol was originally
specified in bracketed form.

There are cases in which a SLIF symbol needs to be 
referred to by name in Perl code.
In this cases, it is the symbols explicit name
that is used.

=head2 Single quoted strings

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Number bless => primary
        | '(' Expression ')' bless => paren assoc => group
       || Expression '**' Expression bless => exponentiate assoc => right
       || Expression '*' Expression bless => multiply
        | Expression '/' Expression bless => divide
       || Expression '+' Expression bless => add
        | Expression '-' Expression bless => subtract

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Single quotes can be used in prioritized
rules to indicate character strings.
The characters inside the single quote
will be matched in the input, literally and one-for-one.
Single quoted strings can contain any characters with
the exception of
single quotes and vertical whitespace.

Single quoted strings do not allow "escaped" characters.
A backslash ("C<\>") represents itself and has no effect
on the interpretation of the next character.
If a rule needs to match one of the forbidden characters
(single quote or vertical whitespace), it must use a
character class.

Single quoted strings are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a single quoted string is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

=head2 Character classes

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    <vertical space char> ~ [\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A character class in square brackets ("C<[]>")
can be used in a RHS alternative of a prioritized rule,
or on the RHS of a quantified rule or a discard rule.
Marpa character classes may contain anything acceptable to Perl,
and follow the same escaping conventions as Perl's character classes.

Character classes are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a character class is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

An implementation note: character classes are
interpreted by Perl, but this involves minimal overhead
when the parse is of any length.
Each character class is
passed to Perl to interpret exactly once and the result is
memoized in a C language structure for future use.

=head1 Rules and statements

The BNF operator ("C<::=>")
indicates that the rule is
a G1 rule.
The match operator ("C<~>")
can be used between the LHS and RHS of a rule,
instead of the BNF operator.
Rules which use the match operator are G0 rules.
The effect of a rule is sometimes lexical --
that is, the effect may vary depending
on the position of the rule in the DSL source.

Statements
are signified by the assignment operator ("C<=>").
Their effect is global, never lexical.
The location of a statement in the DSL source
will never affect the result.

Every rule declaration consists of, in order:

=over 4

=item * A left hand side (LHS).
This will be a
symbol or a pseudo-symbol.

=item * A declaration operator ("C<::=>" or "C<~>").

=item * A right side declaration.

=back

For each type of rule,
the right side declaration is described in detail below.
Among the things a right side declaration may contain are:

=over 4

=item * Zero or more RHS alernatives.
A RHS alternative is a series of RHS primaries,
where a RHS primary may be a symbol name,
a character class,
or a single quoted string.

=item * An list of zero or more adverbs.
Each adverb consists of a keyword,
the adverb operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the adverb's value.

=back

Note that most rules are classified as "prioritized rules",
although the prioritization may be trivial.
For example,
a rule like the following,

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    a ::= b c d

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

whose RHS consists only of a sequence of symbols,
is a prioritized rule.
The prioritization is trivial --
there is only one priority,
and in fact only one alternative within
that priority.
In typical grammars,
most rules will be prioritized rules,
and many of them will be trivially prioritized.

=head2 Start rule

Every source string should have a start rule.
The LHS of this rule is the C<:start> pseudo-symbol.
The RHS must be a single symbol name.
The start rule does not accept any adverbs.
Start rules must be G1 rules.

=head2 Empty rules

An empty rule is a rule with an empty RHS.
An empty right hand side is what the name suggests: no symbols
or punctuation.
The C<action> and
C<bless> adverbs are allowed with empty rules,
but no others.
A empty rule makes its LHS symbol a nullable symbol.

=head2 Quantified rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Script ::= Expression+ separator => comma

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A rule is a quantified rule if
its RHS consists of a single symbol,
followed by a "quantifier".
A "single symbol" in this context is a symbol name or a character class.
The quantifer is either
a star ("C<*>"),
or a plus sign ("C<+>")
indicating, respectively, that the sequence rule has a minimum length
of 0 or 1.

Quantified rules allow the C<action>,
C<bless>,
C<proper> and
C<separator> adverbs.

=head2 Prioritized rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Number bless => primary
        | '(' Expression ')' bless => paren assoc => group
       || Expression '**' Expression bless => exponentiate assoc => right
       || Expression '*' Expression bless => multiply
        | Expression '/' Expression bless => divide
       || Expression '+' Expression bless => add
        | Expression '-' Expression bless => subtract

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Any rule that is not a start rule,
and that is not empty or quantified, is considered prioritized.
The prioritization is often trivial, consisting only of a
single priority level.

Each prioritized right hand side consists of one or more right hand alternatives
(called "alternatives" for brevity).
An alternative is a series of one or more symbols,
followed by zero or more adverbs.
The 
C<action>,
C<assoc> and
C<bless> adverbs are allowed.

The alternatives are separated by single or double "or" symbols.
This means the alternatives in a prioritized right hand side proceed
from tightest (highest) priority to loosest.
The double "or" symbol ("C<||>") is the "loosen" operator --
the alternatives after it
have a looser (lower) priority than the alternatives before it.
The single "or" symbol ("C<|>") is the ordinary "alternative" operator --
alternatives on each side of it have the same priority.
Associativity is specified using adverbs, as described below.

Within an alternative, symbols may be enclosed in parentheses.
A symbol enclosed in parentheses is hidden from
L<Marpa's semantics|Marpa::R2::Semantics>.
A set of parentheses may contain more than one symbol,
in which case the entire sequence of symbols is hidden,
as if they had been enclosed in parentheses individually.

=head2 Discard rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :discard ~ whitespace

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

A discard rule is a rule whose LHS is
the C<:discard> pseudo-symbol,
and whose RHS is a single symbol name,
called the B<discarded symbol>.
These rules indicate that the discarded symbol is a top-level G0
symbol, but one which is not a lexeme.
When a discarded symbol is recognized,
it is not passed as a lexeme to the G1 parser, but is
(as the name suggests) discarded.
Discard rules must be G0 rules.
No adverbs are allowed.

=head2 Default pseudo-rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :default ::= action => [values] bless => ::lhs

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The default pseudo-rule changes the defaults for
rule adverbs.
Default pseudo-rules do not affect the defaults for G0 rules
or for lexemes.
There may be more than one default pseudo-rule.
The scope of default pseudo-rules is lexical, applying only to rules
that appear afterwards in the DSL source.

Currently only the defaults for
the C<action> and C<bless> adverbs
can be specified in a default pseudo-rule.
Each default pseudo-rule creates a completely new
set of defaults -- if an adverb is not specified,
it is reset to its original default, the one it had
before any default pseudo-rules were encountered.

=head2 Lexeme pseudo-rules

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF lexeme rule synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <say keyword> priority => 1

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<:lexeme> pseudo-rule allows adverbs to be used to
change the treatment of a lexeme.
The only adverbs allowed in a C<:lexeme> rule
are
L<C<priority>|/"priority">
and
L<C<pause>|/"pause">.

As a side effect, a C<:lexeme> pseudo-rules
declares that a symbol is a lexeme.
This declaration does not "force" lexeme status --
if the symbol does not meet the criteria for a lexeme
based on its use in G0 and G1 rules,
the result will be a fatal error.
Applications may find the ability to "declare"
lexemes useful for debugging,
and for documentating grammars.

=head2 Lexeme default statement

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    lexeme default = action => [start,length,value] bless => ::name

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The lexeme default statement changes the defaults for
lexeme adverbs.
It only changes the defaults for lexemes,
and does not affect rules.
Only the defaults for
the C<action> and C<bless> adverbs
can be specified in a lexeme default statement.
Only one lexeme default statement is allowed in a file.

=head2 Named event statement

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF completed event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event subtext = completed <subtext>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF nulled event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event 'A[]' = nulled <A>

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF predicted event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event '^a' = predicted A

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The named event statement sets up a symbol
so that a named event is triggered
when some condition occurs at a location.
Named events
can be defined to occur when
a symbol is predicted,
when a symbol is completed,
or 
when a symbol is nulled.

A "completed" event
occurs whenever a rule with that symbol on
its LHS is fully recognized in the parse.
(The idea is that "symbol completion" occurs when the
rule, and therefore its LHS, is "complete".)
For the purpose of "completed" events,
a nulled symbol is not considered "complete",
and "completed" events will not be triggered
for a zero-length instance of a symbol.

A "nulled" event occurs whenever a zero-length symbol instance
is recognized.
Null symbols may derive other null symbols,
and these derivations may be ambiguous.
Ambiguous or not,
all such derivations cause "nulled" events.
Again, nulled events and completed events are mutually
exclusive -- a nulled, or zero-length, symbol is not considered
"complete" for this purpose.

A "predicted" event occurs at any location where a non-zero length
symbol would be accepted by the recognizer.
It can be thought of as occurring when a symbol is "expected".
The expectation may or may not come true, depending on future
input.
Because there is no physical distinction between expecting
a zero-length symbol,
and actually seeing one,
"predicted" events are not generated for symbols which
are only expected in zero-length form.

Completed and nulled events may not be defined
for symbols that are lexemes, but lexemes are allowed to be predicted
events.
A predicted event which is a lexeme is different from a lexeme pause.
The lexeme pause will not occur unless that the lexeme is actually
found in the input.
A predicted event, on the other hand, is
as the name suggests, only a prediction.
The predicted symbol may or not actually be found in the input.

The name of an event may be either a bare name,
or enclosed in single quotes.
A bare event name must be one or more word characters,
starting with an alphabetic character.
A single quoted event name may contain any character
except a single quote or vertical space.
The whitespace in single quoted event names is normalized
in similar fashion to the normalization of symbol names --
leading and trailing whitespace is removed,
and all sequences of internal whitespace are changed to
a single ASCII space character.
Names containing single quotes (which, in any case,
are impossible to add using
current syntax) are reserved.

Named completion events can occur during the
L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">,
L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()">,
L<lexeme_complete()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()">,
and L<lexeme_read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()">
methods.
When they occur
in L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">,
and L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()"> methods,
they pause internal scanning.
Named events may be queried using
L<the Scanless recognizer's event()
method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"event()">.

=head1 Adverbs

Adverbs consist of a keyword, the adverb operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the adverb's value.
The keyword must be one of those described in this section.
The adverb's value must be as described for each keyword.

=head2 action

The C<action> adverb is allowed for

=over 4

=item *

An RHS alternative of a G1 prioritized rule, in which the action is for the alternative.

=item *

G1 rules other than prioritized rules, in which case the action is for the rule.

=item *

The default pseudo-rule, in which case the action is for all rules which do not
have their own action explicitly specified.

=item *

The lexeme default statement, in which case the action is for all lexemes.

=back

The C<action> adverb is not allowed for G0 rules.
The possible values of actions are described in
L<their own section|/"Actions">.
Details of the semantics are given in
L<their own document|Marpa::R2::Semantics>.

=head2 assoc

The C<assoc> adverb is only valid in a prioritized rule.
Its value must be one of
C<left>,
C<right> or
C<group>.
Its effect will be as described
L<below|/"Precedence">.

=head2 bless

The C<bless> adverb causes the result of the semantics to be
blessed into the class indicated by the value of the adverb.
The C<bless> adverb is allowed for alternatives of prioritized G1 rules,
quantified G1 rules,
and lexemes.
The C<bless> adverb is also allowed for the default lexeme statement
and the default pseudo-rule.
A G0 rule cannot have a C<bless> adverb.

The value of a C<bless> adverb is called a B<blessing>.
If the blessing is a Perl word
(a string of alphanumerics or underscores),
the name of the class will be formed by prepending
the value of L<the C<bless_package>
named argument|Marpa::R2::Scanless::G/"bless_package">, followed
by a double colon ("C<::>").

If the blessing begins with a double colon ("C<::>"), it is a
reserved blessing.
A blessing of C<::undef> means that the rule or lexeme will not be blessed.
By default, both
rules and lexemes are not blessed.
If any rule or lexeme of a SLIF grammar has
a blessing other than C<::undef>,
a C<bless_package> is required,
and failure to specify one results in
a fatal error.

The bless adverb for
rules allows one additional reserved blessing: C<::lhs>.
A blessing of C<::lhs> causes the result to be blessed into
a class whose name is based on the LHS of the rule.
The class will be the name of the LHS with whitespace
changed to an underscore.
(As a reminder, the whitespace in symbol names will have been normalized,
with leading and trailing whitespace removed,
and all other whitespace sequences changed to a single ASCII space.)
When a C<::lhs> blessing value applies to a rule, it is a fatal
error if the LHS contains anything other than alphanumerics
and whitespace.
In particular, the LHS cannot already contain an underscore ("C<_>").
The C<::lhs> blessing is most useful in a default rule.

The bless adverb for lexemes allows only one
reserved value: C<::name>.
A reserved value of C<::name> causes the value of the lexeme to be blessed into
a class whose name is based on the name of the lexeme.
The class is derived from the symbol name in the same way,
and subject to the same restrictions,
as described above for deriving a class name from the LHS
of a rule.
The C<::name> reserved blessing is most useful in
the lexeme default rule.

=head2 event

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF named lexeme event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <a> pause => before event => 'before a'
    :lexeme ~ <b> pause => after event => 'after b'
    :lexeme ~ <c> pause => before event => 'before c'
    :lexeme ~ <d> pause => after event => 'after d'

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<event> adverb applies only to lexemes.
It turns a lexeme's pause into a named event,
using the name specified as its value.
Applications are encouraged to turn all lexeme
pause's into named events,
using the C<event> adverb.
The allowed event names are as described
for the L<named event statement|"Named event statement">.

It is a fatal error to specify the C<event> adverb
if the C<pause> adverb is not also specified.

=head2 null-ranking

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: null-ranking adverb example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    S ::= A A A A null-ranking => high

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<null-ranking> adverb applies only to rules.
and is ignored unless
the recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
The C<null_ranking> named argument allows the application
to control the order in which rules with nullable symbols
are returned by the C<value> method.
Such rules can match the same input in several ways
depending on which symbols are nulled.
These different ways of nulling symbols in a rule
are called its null variants.

If C<null_ranking> is undefined,
the order of the null variants will be arbitrary.
This is the default,
and is acceptable to most applications.
For details on using the
C<null_ranking> named argument,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::R2::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 pause

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF named lexeme event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <a> pause => before event => 'before a'
    :lexeme ~ <b> pause => after event => 'after b'
    :lexeme ~ <c> pause => before event => 'before c'
    :lexeme ~ <d> pause => after event => 'after d'

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<pause> adverb applies only to lexemes.
Pauses take effect during
L<the Scanless recognizer's read()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">
and L<resume()|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()"> methods.
They cause internal scanning
to be suspended, or "paused", before
or after the specified lexeme.
Internal scanning can be resumed with
L<the Scanless recognizer's resume()
method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()">.

Applications are encouraged to name every lexeme pause
using the L<event adverb|/"event">.
If this is done, lexeme pauses can be queried using the
SLIF recognizer's
L<events() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"events()">.
Unnamed lexeme pauses must be queried using the
SLIF recognizer's
L<pause_lexeme() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"pause_lexeme()">.

If the value of pause is C<before>,
Marpa will "pause" internal scanning before
that lexeme.
No lexemes will be read at that position.

If the value of pause is C<after>,
all appicable lexemes at that position will
be read by G1,
and internal scanning will pause immediately
afterwards.

A lexeme pause event does not occur, and has no effect, if

=over 4

=item *

It is deactivated.  Deactivation and reactivation of events is
done with the SLIF recognizer's
L<activate() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"activate()">

=item *

The G1 grammar would reject that lexeme at that location.

=item *

It has
a lexeme priority lower than
the highest lexeme priority.

=item *

At the same priority,
it has a pause value of C<after>,
when another lexeme pause occurs
which has a 
pause value of C<before>.
In other words, pausing before a lexeme prevents Marpa
from pausing
after another lexeme at the same location.

=back

Even with the above restrictions,
there can be more than one lexeme pause event at a location.
The
L<pause_lexeme() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"pause_lexeme()">
will return only one of them, chosen arbitrarily, whereas
the 
L<events() method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"events()">
will return all of the named events.
This is one of the reasons that applications
are strongly encouraged to specify a name for every lexeme pause event
using the C<event> adverb.

=head2 priority

The C<priority> adverb is only allowed in
L<a C<:lexeme>
pseudo-rule|/"Lexeme pseudo-rule">.
It sets the lexeme priority for the lexeme.
Priority must be an integer.
It may be negative.
The default priority is zero.

Where more than one lexeme can be accepted at
a location, the lexeme priority limits the lexemes
that will be considered.
Only lexemes with the highest priority are considered.
If several lexemes have the same priority,
all of them will be accepted.

The only effect of the lexeme priority
is on the choice
of lexemes when

=over 4

=item * all of them would be accepted;

=item * all started at the same string location;

=item * all end at the same string location; and therefore

=item * all have the same length.

=back

Lexeme priorities only have
an effect when lexemes are accepted.
The intent of this scheme is avoid situations where a lexeme
with a high priority is rejected, and causes a parse to fail,
even though another lower priority lexeme is acceptable
and would allow the parse to continue.

For example, suppose that "C<say>" can be both
a keyword (C<< <say keyword> >>),
and a variable name (C<< <variable> >>).
Suppose further that
the grammar specifies that C<< <say keyword> >> has a priority of 1,
and C<< <variable> >> is left at the default priority of 0.
When G0 finds a occurrence of "C<say>",
where both the C<say> keyword and a variable name would
be accepted by G1, then only the C<say> keyword is read by G1,
because of the priorities.

But, suppose instead that the parse is at a location
where G1 is not accepting
the C<< <say keyword> >>.
Since only lexeme priorites of acceptable lexemes are considered,
C<< <variable> >> lexeme
has the highest priority,
and the literal string "C<say>" will be read as a
C<< <variable> >>
token.

=head2 proper

The C<proper> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a boolean,
in the form of a binary digit (C<0> or C<1>).
It is only relevant is a separator
is defined and is 1 if proper separation
is required, and 0 if Perl separation is allowed.
"Perl separation" allows a final separator.
"Proper separation" is so called, because it requires
that separators be "proper" in the sense that they
must actually separating
sequence items.

=head2 rank

C<rank> is ignored unless
the recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
The range allowed for C<rank> is implementation-defined,
but numbers in the range
between -134,217,727 and 134,217,727
will always be allowed.
C<rank> is 0 by default.
For details on using the
C<rank> named argument,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::R2::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 separator

The C<separator> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a symbol of the grammar.
If specified, that symbol must separate items of the sequence.
A separator symbol may not be nullable.

=head1 Actions

=head2 Perl identifers

If the action value is a Perl identifier,
it is treated as the name of a Perl variable,
but one which still must be fully qualified by adding a package name.
For this purpose, a Perl identifier is a sequence of one or more alphanumerics
and underscores.
A Perl identifier will be fully qualified by prefixing the name of the semantic package,
and then dealt with as described for L<"Fully qualified Perl names">.

For example, if the action value
is "C<some_var>", the action value will be regarded as a Perl identifer.
If the semantics package is "C<My_Actions>", Marpa will convert the action
value to "C<My_Actions::some_var>", and hand
it on for processing as a fully qualified Perl name.
is "C<some_var>", the action value will be regarded as a Perl identifer.
For more details on qualifying Perl identifiers, see
L<the document on SLIF semantics|Marpa::R2::Semantics>.

=head2 Fully qualified Perl names

If an action value is a series of two or more Perl identifiers
separated by double colons ("C<::>"), it is treated as it was a fully qualified Perl name.
Fully qualified Perl names are also obtained from action names which look like
unqualified Perl names, by prefixing the semantics package, as described above.
(Note that an action value starting with a double colon is always treated as a reserved
action name and is B<not> regarded as Perl name.)

Once Marpa has a fully qualified Perl name, it looks in Perl's symbol tables for
a Perl variable with that name,
either the name of a subroutine, or of a scalar.
It is important to note that for the purposes of Perl's symbol tables,
and therefore for the purposes of Marpa's resolution of Perl names,
references are scalars.
If Marpa finds a Perl subroutine with that fully qualified Perl name,
the action name is resolved to that subroutine,
which then becomes a B<semantic closure>.
If Marpa does not find
a Perl subroutine with that name,
but does find a scalar Perl variable with that name,
the action name is resolved to that Perl variable.
(Again, for this purpose a Perl reference is a kind of Perl scalar.)

=head Resolution to Perl variables

If the action name resolves to a scalar Perl variable,
that is the value of the rule.
Users should note that the resolution to a Perl variable resolves to the same
variable every time.
Further, assuming no trickery with Perl's C<local> keyword take place,
this Perl variable will be global in scope.
This means that good practice suggest that resolution to Perl variables be restricted
to constants.

For example, it may seem easier to initialize a hash in a parse tree
using an action which returns a reference to an empty hash.
Unfortunately for this purpose, this will be the same hash for
all its users, and any change to it will be seen by all users.
This is almost certainly not what is wanted.
Users who want an action that returns an different empty hash every time
it is invoked, which is almost always what is wanted,
will need their action to resolve to a semantic closure,
not a Perl variable.

=head2 Resolution to a Perl semantic closure

Ordinarily, the arguments to the semantic closure are the per-parse-tree
variable,
followed by values of the rule's child nodes,
in the order in which they occurred in the input stream.
However,
if a rule with a word action is blessed,
in order to allow the blessing to take effect,
the arguments to a semantic closure are formed differently.
If the rule is blessed, its semantic closure will always have
exactly two arguments.
The first will be the per-parse-tree variable.
The second will be a blessed array that contains
the child values in input-stream order.

Note that the above implies that resolution can be either to a Perl subroutine
or to a reference to a Perl subroutine, but that the result will be very different.
The Perl subroutine will be treated as a semantic closure, and executed to produce
the value of the node.
The reference to a subroutine will B<NOT> be treated as a semantic closure,
and will not be executed.
The reference to a Perl subtroutine will be passed on, as is, as the value of the node.

=head2 Reserved actions

If the action value begins with a double colon ("C<::>"),
it is a reserved action.
The following are recognized:

=over 4

=item * C<::array>

The value of the rule or lexeme is an array.
For a rule, the array will
contain the
values of each of its children, in left-to-right order.
If the rule has no children, the array will be empty.
For a lexeme, the array will be of length one,
and will contain the token value.

=item * C<::first>

The value of the rule is that of the rule's first child.
If there is no such child, the value is a Perl C<undef>.

It is a fatal error if a blessing
is applied to a rule with a C<::first> action.
This is the case even when either or both adverbs are
the result of a default.
It is also a fatal error to use a C<::first> action
with a lexeme.

=item * C<::undef>

The value of the rule or lexeme is 
a Perl C<undef>.
It is a fatal error if a blessing
is applied to a rule with a C<::undef> action.
This is the case even when either or both adverbs are
the result of a default.

=back

=head2 Array descriptor actions

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF DSL synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    lexeme default = action => [start,length,value] bless => ::name

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

If an action is enclosed in square brackets, it is an B<array descriptor>,
and the value of the lexeme or rule will be an array.
Inside the array descriptor should a comma separated list of zero or more array
descriptor items.
The B<array descriptor items> are keywords that describe how the array is to be filled
out.

If the array descriptor is an empty pair of square brackets ("C<[]>"),
then there are zero array descriptor items,
and the value will be an empty array.
Otherwise the "array descriptor item" keywords are interpreted as lists
and those lists are used to fill out the 
array.
A C<start> array descriptor item will put
the start location of the rule or lexeme into the array.
The C<length> array descriptor item will put
the length of the rule or lexeme into the array.
The start location is an offset in the input string.
Length is in characters
and is defined such that the end location
is always start location plus length.

For a rule,
the C<values> array descriptor item indicates a list containing
the values of
the rule's children, in left-to-right order.
For a lexeme, 
the C<value> array descriptor item indicates a list
containing a single element,
the token value of the lexeme.

C<::array> is equivalent to C<[values]>.
The C<value> and C<values> array descriptor items are synonyms,
and may be used interchangeably for both rules and lexemes.
This means that, for both lexemes and rules,
the actions C<[values]>, C<[value]> and C<::array>
will do exactly the same thing.

The array descriptor item keywords fill out the array in
the order in which they appear in the the array descriptor.
For example, if we are dealing with a rule,
and the array descriptor is "C<[start,length,value]>",
then the return value is an reference to an array,
whose length will vary, but which will be contain least
three elements.
The first element will be the start location in the
input string of this rule instance,
and the second will be its length.
The remaining elements will be
the values of the rule's RHS children,
in lexical order,
as computed according to the semantics
of those children.

=head1 Precedence

Marpa's precedence is a generalization beyond the traditional ideas of precedence.
Traditional precedence parsing required
the classification of operators as postfix, infix, etc.
Marpa's precedence parsing is NOT based on
the special treatment of operators.

For the purpose of precedence,
an operand is an occurrence in a RHS alternative
of the LHS symbol.
An operator is considered to be anything 
that is not an operand.
The arity of an alternative is the number of operands that
it contains.
All arities are allowed, from zero to the arbitrary
number imposed by system limits such as memory and file size.

For example, in the synopsis, the LHS symbol is
C<Expression>.  The alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

        (<op lparen>) Expression (<op rparen>)

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

contains one occurrence of C<Expression> and therefore has an arity of one.
The C<< <op lparen> >> and C<< <op rparen> >> are considered operators.

In the RHS alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

       Expression (<op pow>) Expression

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

C<Expression> occurs twice, and therefore the arity is 2.
C<< <op pow> >> is considered to be an operator.

Because for this purpose an operator is defined as anything that
is not an operand, Marpa treats some symbols as operators
that would not be considered operators in the traditional approach.
For example,
in the RHS alternative

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Stuifzand Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

       Number

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

there are no occurrences of C<Expression>, so that the alternative
has an arity of zero -- it is nullary.
The symbol C<Number> is considered to be an operator.

An alternative with arity 0 is nullary.
Precedence and associativity
are meaningless in this
case and will be ignored.

An alternative with arity 1 is unary.
Precedence will have effect,
but left and right associativity will not.

An alternative with arity 2 is binary.
Precedence will have effect,
and left and right associativity will behave
in the traditional way,
The traditional behavior for binary alternatives
is exactly as described next for the I<N>-ary case.

An alternative with an arity of I<N>,
where I<N> is 2 or greater, is I<N>-ary.
Precedence will have effect.
For left associativity,
only the leftmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- operands
after the first will have the
next-tightest priority level.
For right associativity,
only the rightmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- all operands
except the last
will have the next-tightest priority level.

Marpa also allows "group" associativity.
In "group" associativity, all operands associate
at the loosest (lowest) priority.
That is, in an alternative with group associativity,
each operand may be a full expression of the kind
defined by the prioritized rule.
"Group" associativity is used, for example,
in implementing the traditional function of parentheses
in Marpa.
Group associativity is meaningless for nullary alternatives,
and is ignored.

=head1 Caveats

=head2 Symbol names

The SLIF may rewrite its symbol names internally.
Here we call the name by which a symbol is specified in the
SLIF source string its "external symbol name",
and its name as rewritten, its "internal symbol name".
In many cases, Marpa::R2 makes sure the user sees only
the external names of symbols.
For example,
L<the SLIF grammar's C<rule()> method|Marpa::R2::Scanless::G/"rule()">
returns external symbol names.

However,
for some purposes, such as tracing grammars, the use of
internal names may sometimes
be appropriate.
Marpa::R2's use of external and internal symbol names
is evolving.
When the SLIF is used,
except as documented in this section,
the user may see either the internal or external form
of a symbol's name.
Additionally, the exact form of the internal name is
subject to change.

=head2 Precedence: the good news

Marpa's generalization of precedence works
for all grammars that
can be defined by prioritized rules.
It is efficient (linear) for all grammars that could be
parsed by the traditional precedence parsing methods.
Marpa also allows you to define alternatives
not allowed by traditional methods.
Many of these are useful,
and most of the useful ones can be parsed efficiently.

=head2 Precedence and ambiguous grammars

Because of the many forms of recursion allowed,
it is possible
to define highly ambiguous grammars using the precedence mechanism.
This can occur even by accident.

The user should especially be careful with
right hand side alternatives in
which all the symbols are operands.
These can be useful.
For example, an implicit operation can be defined using
an binary alternative with no non-operands,
and this could implement, for example,
the standard notation for concatenation or multiplication.
But to do this efficiently
requires either avoiding ambiguity,
or controlling its use carefully.

Marpa does catch the case where an alternative consists
only of a single operand -- a "unit rule".
This causes a fatal error.
Unit rules are easy to define by accident in
the Stuifzand interface.
The author knows of no practical use for them,
and their presence in a grammar is usually
unintentional.
Note that, in the event an application
does find a use for a grammar with unit rules,
Marpa's standard interface can parse it.
