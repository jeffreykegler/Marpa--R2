Marpa::R2::Tracing - Tracing your grammar

=head1 Description

This document is an overview of
the techniques for tracing and
debugging parses and grammars using Marpa's SLIF interface.

=head1 Basic techniques

=head2 Check the input location where parsing failed

If parsing failed in the recognizer,
look at the input location where it happened.
Compare the input against the grammar.
This step is fairly obvious,
but I include it because
even experts (actually, especially experts)
will sometimes overlook the obvious
in a rush to use more advanced techniques.

=head2 Trace terminals

Set the L<C<trace_terminals> recognizer named
argument|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"trace_terminals">
to 1.
This tells you which tokens the recognizer is looking for and which ones it thinks it found.
If the problem is in lexing, C<trace_terminals> tells you the whole story.
Even if the problem is not in the lexing,
tracing terminals can tell you a lot.

=head2 Trace progress

Tracing the recognizer's progress
with
C<show_progress>
is most powerful tool available
in the basic toolkit.
C<show_progress>
should provide all the
information necessary to
debug an application's grammar.
L<A separate document|Marpa::R2::Progress>
explains how to interpret the progress reports.
That document includes an
example of the use of C<show_progress>
to debug an error in a grammar.

=head2 Double check rules and symbols

It sometimes helps to look carefully at the output of
L<C<show_symbols>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::G/"show_symbols()">
and
L<C<show_rules>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::G/"show_rules()">.
Check if anything there is
not what you expected.
For thorough checking, it can be helpful to use a
verbosity level higher than 1.

=head2 Other traces

Setting the L<SLIF recognizer's C<trace_values> named argument|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"trace_values">
to a trace level of 1
traces the values of the parse tree nodes as they are pushed on, and
popped off, the evaluation stack.

=head2 Basic checklist

A full investigation of a parse
includes the following:

=over 4

=item * Set the C<trace_terminals> recognizer named argument to level 1.

=item * Run C<show_rules> on the SLIF grammar.

=item * Run C<show_symbols> on the SLIF grammar.

=item * Run C<show_progress> on the SLIF recognizer.

=item * Set the C<trace_values> evaluator named argument to level 1.

=back

When considering how much tracing to turn on,
remember that if the input text to the grammar is large,
the outputs from
C<trace_terminals>,
C<show_progress>,
and C<trace_values>
will be very lengthy.
You want to work with short inputs when possible.
