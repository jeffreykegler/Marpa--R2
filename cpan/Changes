   * Per-parse arg can now be specified explicitly as arg
     of $slr->value().

   * Added semantics_package named argument to SLIF recognizer.

   * Fix bug: unproductive symbol in G0 sequence was causing SEGV
     instead of diagnostic.

   * Fix SLIF bug when using default action with null parse --
     default action was not being called, it now is.

2.068000 Thu Aug 22 19:13:34 PDT 2013

   * Better debugging and tracing for SLIF,
     and better documentation for it.

   * Fix SLIF memory leak; fix for Perl 5.19.3

     Fix SEGV when terminal symbol is unused.

2.062000 Tue Jul  2 08:23:53 PDT 2013

     Lexemes pauses can be now be named events, and
     as named events can be deactivated and reactivated

   * Rearrange POD to make SLIF primary interface

   * Added accessors to Scanless::R

   * Fix bug found by Jean-Damien: combining
     ambiguity and SLIF external scanning caused
     segment violation.
     
2.054000 Wed May 15 12:54:00 PDT 2013

   * Added completion events

2.052000

2.048000 Sun Mar 10 17:59:11 PDT 2013

     * New options (blessed arrays) allow direct generation
       of AST's from SLIF

     * Optimization of valuator and SLIF

2.046000 Wed Feb  6 08:24:05 PST 2013

     * Core logic of Scanless recognizer converted to C --
       it is now more than 10 times faster.

2.044000 Mon Jan 28 19:42:06 PST 2013

      * Fix 64-bit Windows failures.

2.042000 Tue Jan 22 17:15:50 PST 2013

      * Scanless interface now supports Unicode.

2.040000 Sat Jan  5 08:33:52 PST 2013

     * Fixed two cases in the Scanless interface.  In
       one case, parse exhaustion at the G1 level was
       treated as an error.  In the other, the G0 level
       assumed there would be at least one :discard rule,
       and had problems if there were none.

2.038000 Wed Jan  2 09:14:38 PST 2013

     * The Scanless G0 rule order depended
       indirectly on the order of
       keys in a Perl hash.  Fixed that.

2.036000 Tue Jan  1 00:54:36 PST 2013
 
     * Documentation for the Stuifzand (BNF) and
       Scanless interfaces is complete.  They are
       now in full release.

     * Fix problem with negative rule ranks.

     * Stuifzand and Scanless interfaces are complete
       and tested.  Only lack of documentation prevented
       them from being taken out of beta.

2.032000 Sun Dec  9 10:19:50 PST 2012

      * Speed up precomputation of large grammars.

        OpenBSD.

        using Config::AutoConf

        Marpa::R2::HTML; now requires only
        HTML::Parser, not HTML::PullParser;

        method removed from documentation.
