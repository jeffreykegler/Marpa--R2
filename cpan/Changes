2.040000 Sat Jan  5 08:33:52 PST 2013

     * Fixed two cases in the Scanless interface.  In
       one case, parse exhaustion at the G1 level was
       treated as an error.  In the other, the G0 level
       assumed there would be at least one :discard rule,
       and had problems if there were none.

2.038000 Wed Jan  2 09:14:38 PST 2013

     * The Scanless G0 rule order depended
       indirectly on the order of
