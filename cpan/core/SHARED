This document describes how to link an external shared library with
Marpa::R2.  This method, and this document, are intended for re-packagers
and other very advanced users.  This method is not supported by the CPAN
infrastructure.  Most users should prefer the basic method described in
the INSTALL document at the top level of the Marpa::R2 CPAN directory.

This document only describes those aspects of linking which are special
to shared libraries.  This document assumes you have already read the
STATIC document, which contains, along with instructions for linking
static libraries, many instructions applicable to linking with external
libraries in general.  That material is not repeated here.

Here are the steps:

1.) As with linking a static library, you must ensure that the version
of the library is an exact match to the one that Marpa::R2 expects.
For more detail, refer back to the "STATIC" document.

2.) Build an external shared library using the separate Libmarpa
repository.  Instructions on how to build Libmarpa can be found beginning
in the INSTALL file at the top level of the Libmarpa repository.
Libmarpa's repository is here: https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa

3.) Install the external shared library.  Where and how you install it
is up to you.  The Libmarpa distribution is set up to use autoconf.
Instructions on how to install using autoconf can be found in the
autoconf documentation.  Here, we will assume that, for test purposes,
you have installed the external static library in /tmp/libmarpa.so.

4.) To build and test

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp ./Build test --libmarpa-external=/tmp/libmarpa.so

or

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp ./Build test --libmarpa-external=-L/tmp\ -lmarpa

Note that, in each case, the location of the library is specified twice.
The linker needs to find the library using the flags, as specified in the
"--libmarpa-external" option.  At runtime, however, the tester cannot
assume that is where the shared library is installed and, in this example,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used so that Libmarpa can be found at runtime.

5.)  To switch back to an internal Libmarpa, specify the
"--libmarpa-external" option.

   ./Build code --libmarpa-internal=on


LD_LIBRARY_PATH
===============

Readers should be aware the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in actual installations
is controversial.  This example is of a testing situation.
