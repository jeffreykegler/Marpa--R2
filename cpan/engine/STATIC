This document describes how to link an external static library with
Marpa::R2.  This method, and this document, are intended for re-packagers
and other very advanced users.  This method is not supported by the CPAN
infrastructure.  Most users should prefer the basic method described in
the INSTALL document at the top level of the Marpa::R2 CPAN directory.

Here are the steps:

1.) Be sure the library that you are building is a match to the one
that Marpa::R2 expects.  The expected version can be found in the
core/read_only/LIB_VERSION file.  Do *NOT* edit this file.  This version
number must match exactly the version number of your external static
library.

2.) Build an external static library using the separate Libmarpa
repository.  Instructions on how to build Libmarpa can be found beginning
in the INSTALL file at the top level of the Libmarpa repository.
Libmarpa's repository is here: https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa

3.) Install the external static library.  Where and how you install it
is up to you.  The Libmarpa distribution is set up to use autoconf.
Instructions on how to install using autoconf can be found in the
autoconf documentation.  Here, we will assume that, for test purposes,
you have installed the external static library in /tmp/libmarpa.a.

4.) Build Marpa::R2 to use the external static library.

   ./Build code --libmarpa-external=/tmp/libmarpa.a

or, to build and test

   ./Build test --libmarpa-external=/tmp/libmarpa.a

5.)  Once, you've switched to an external Libmarpa, a
"--libmarpa-external" option *must* be specified every time you use
"Build" with a target which has Libmarpa as a dependency.  If you forget
to specify a "--libmarpa-external" option, ./Build will abend with
an error message.  To go back to using the internal Libmarpa, use the
"--libmarpa-internal" option.

   ./Build code --libmarpa-internal=on

TAGS
====

You can configure Libmarpa to include a "tag" which identifies it.
If Libmarpa is compiled with GCC, the tag defaults to a time stamp,
but it can be set explicitly: For instructions on how to set the tag,
see the installation documentation of Libmarpa.

The tag appears at the beginning of Marpa::R2's test output:

    t/00-load.t ............ 1/4 # Marpa::R2 version is 2.085_004
    # Libmarpa version is 6.0.3
    # Libmarpa tag: testing123

LINKER FLAGS
============

The value of "libmarpa-external" option is passed literally as a set of
arguments to the linker, after being split on whitespace.  This means
it is not restricted to being only the name of the static library to
be linked.  It can also be used to pass other kinds of arguments to
the linker.
