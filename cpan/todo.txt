* Add null_ranking adverb

* Display for Null POD

* Add test for $slr->reset_evaluation.  Rename to $slr->series_restart().

* Test for all ranking methods with SLIF?  Do, if not.

* Test SLIF action names
  * When shadowed by CODE slot
  * Scalar but not a ref -- should fatal
  * !Scalar and !Code slot -- should fail to resolve
  * ref to scalar, hash, array -- should resolve as per NAIF

Later:

* Add pseudo-symbols: :null, :empty -- sugar for empty RHS alternative

* Add pseudo-symbols: :external, :never -- sugar for [^\d\D]

* Problem with indirect nulling.  Modifying Semantics::Null to add explicit
  empty production changes semantics.  "Topmost nulled" rule seems not to be
  followed in this case.
