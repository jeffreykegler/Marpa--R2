=head1 NAME

Marpa::R2::Semantics::Infinite - How Marpa deals with infinite cycles

=head1 INFINITELY AMBIGUOUS GRAMMARS

Marpa will parse using an infinitely ambiguous grammar.
(In the technical literature, an infinite ambiguity is more usually
called a B<cycle> or a B<loop>.)

An example of an infinitely ambiguous grammar is the following:

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    S ::= A
    A ::= B
    B ::= A
    B :: 'x'

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Given the input 'x', this grammar will produce
these parses

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    S -> A -> B -> x
    S -> A -> B -> A -> B -> x
    S -> A -> B -> A -> B -> A -> B -> x
    .
    .
    .

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Because of the two rules C<A ::= B> and C<B ::= A>,
this list of parses could go on forever.
The two rules C<A ::= B> and C<B ::= A> form what is called a B<cycle>.

Typically, if a user has written an grammar with an infinite cycle,
it was a mistake and
he wants to rewrite it before proceeding.
By default, an infinitely ambiguous grammar is a fatal error.
This is the behavior most users will want.

To produce parse results from an infinitely ambiguous grammar,
the user must set
the grammar's
L<C<infinite_action>|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"infinite_action">
named argument
to a value other than "C<fatal>".
The other choices are "C<warn>"
and "C<quiet>".

=head1 CYCLE LENGTH

Obviously,
Marpa cannot list all of an infinite number of parse results.
Marpa deals with potentially infinite parses by limiting the
cycle length.
B<Cycle length> is the number of times a parse derivation goes
around a potentially infinite cycle.

Marpa limits all cycles to a length of 1.
There will always be a finite number of these parse results.

Above I showed
a set of parses from an example of an
infinitely ambiguous grammar.
Here are those parses again, this time
labeled with their cycle length.

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    Cycle length 1: S -> A -> B -> x
    Cycle length 2: S -> A -> B -> A -> B -> x
    Cycle length 3: S -> A -> B -> A -> B -> A -> B -> x

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Marpa would return a parse result
only for the first parse tree in the list above,
the one whose cycle length is 1.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The "breakpoint" of a cycle occurs when it loops
back to the same
rule, but the exact placement
of this "same rule" breakpoint is not 
precisely defined at this point.
In particular, internal rewritings of the grammar's rules,
which are otherwise invisible,
can influence the breakpoint.
Applications should avoid
relying on the exact location of cycle breakpoints.

In future releases,
Marpa's behavior may be more carefully defined.
But cycles at this point are universally considered
useless,
and there seems to be literally nobody who
cares about the details of their implementation.
The quality of the present implementation
seems to be fully adequate in terms
of the present interest.
