Marpa::R2::Scanless - Scanless interface

=head1 Synopsis

=head1 Overview

This page is the reference for the Marpa's Scanless interface.

=head1 Two different ways to look at syntax

In describing the syntax of a language, we naturally switch back
and forth between two levels of description.
For example, the Perl docs describe one of the forms that Perl's C<use> statement takes
in this way

    use Module VERSION LIST

On the other hand, Perl's L<perlpodspec> page has a number of statements like this:

    Note that you can distinguish URL-links from anything else
    by the fact that they match m/\A\w+:[^:\s]\S*\z/.

The L<perlpodspec>'s desciption is character by character.
I'll call descriptions at that level lexical descriptions.
The description of the C<use> statement ignores whitespace and all character-level issues.
I'll call its level of description, structural.
For reasons that will become clear later,
I will sometimes call the lexical level, G0,
and will sometimes call the structural level, G1.

The difference is NOT one of precision.
The C<use> statement's structural description is repeated,
in more or less the same form,
in its source code (C<perly.y>).
In that form it is quite precise enough to drive Perl's parser.
Lexical and structural descriptions are equally exact,
but they operate at different levels.

=head1 A very simple language

Let's take a very simple language with a very simple semantics.
The language consists of decimal digits and ASCII spaces,
and it is treated as a series of integers to be added.
Here are three strings in that language

     8675311
     867 5311
     8 6 7 5 3 1 1

According to our semantics,
the three string contain respectively,
one, two and seven integers.
The values of the three strings are,
according to our semantics,
the sum of these integers:
respectively, 8675311, 6178, and 31.

It's often said, in describing languages like the above,
that whitespace is ignored.
From the structural point of view this is, in a sense, true.
But from the lexical point of view it's completely false.
From the overall language description point of view it's also false.
The three string differ only in whitespace, and the placement
of the whitespace clearly makes a vast difference, which has a determining
effect on the structure of string,
and in turn on its semantics.

=head1 The problem

Why not simply insist that the descriptions be lexical,
and take whitespace into proper account?
That is, why not simply ban the structural (G1) level of description?

A hint as to why is provided by the widespread use of structural level,
not just in standards, but also in code like the Perl parser.
Try, as as exercise, to rewrite a complex grammar, taking
into account whitespace.
If you know C, a good example will be C declarations.

    unsigned int a;
    unsigned*b;

In the first of the two lines above the whitespace is necessary.
In the second of the two lines whitespace would be allowed,
but is not necessary.
You cannot simply insist on whitespace between all symbols,
because whitespace is and should be optional between
some symbols and not between others.
Where whitespace is optional, and where it should not be,
depends on the initial and final characters,
and this information is not convenient to represent
at the structural (G1) level.
If you try to represent this,
the size of the grammar grows rapidly,
and the number of special cases even more rapidly.

As the description becomes harder and harder to write,
there becomes less and less point in doing so --
it rapidly gets to the point where nobody could read and
understand it.
This is why languages are usually written in a G1, structural level description,
leaving aside most lexical and whitespace issues.
And this is the case even description is used
for generating production code.

=head1 The scanless interface's solution

Here is full syntax of
the example whitespace-and-digit language,
described using Marpa::R2's scanless interface:

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Scanless concept example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :start ::= <number sequence>
    <number sequence> ::= <number>+ action => add_sequence
    number ~ digit+
    digit ~ [0-9]

    :discard ~ whitespace
    whitespace ~ [\s]+

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

This document is intended for readers already familiar with
Marpa::R2's BNF (Stuifzand) interface.
In this example, three of the scanless interface's extensions
to the Stuifzand interface are used.
First, the tilde ("C<~>") is used to separate LHS and RHS of rules at the lexical
(G0) level.
Rules whose LHS and RHS are separated by the traditional BNF operator ("C<::=>")
are at the structural (G1) level.

Second, Perl character classes are now allowed on the RHS of prioritized and quantified
rules.
The example shows character classes only in G0 rules,
but character classes can also be used in G1 rules.
When a character class is used
in a G1 rule, it still must be implemented at
the G0 level.
Marpa knows this and "does what you mean."

Third, a new type of rule is introduced:
a "discard" rule.
A discard rule has a C<:discard> pseudo-symbol on its LHS
and one symbol name on its RHS.
It indicates that, when the RHS symbol is recognized,
it should not be passed on as usual to the structural (G1) level.
Instead, the lexical (G0) level will simply "discard" what it has
found.
In the example, whitespace is discarded.
