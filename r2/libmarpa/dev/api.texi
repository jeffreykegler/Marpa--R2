@section What is this document?

This document is intended as a reference manual
for a complex low-level tool.
The reader might compare it to the GNU C Language
manual,
which makes no attempt to teach
the C language itself,
much less all the technical knowledge required
to fully understand its contents.

@node Prerequisites, Which chapters to read first, What is this document, How to read this document
@section Prerequisites

This document is very far from self-contained.
It assumes the following:
@itemize
@item
The reader knows the C programming language.
@item
The reader
has read the documents for one of Libmarpa's upper layers.
@item
The reader knows some parsing theory.
@xref{Parsing theory}.
@end itemize

@node Which chapters to read first, Parsing theory, Prerequisites, How to read this document
@section Which chapters to read first

Early chapters of this document lay out concepts,
while later chapters describe Libmarpa's object in
detail,
or deal with optional topics.
This document expects the reader will read its
"concept" chapters first, and in the order of
presentation.
With those as background, the reader should
then be able to read the rest of the material
in the order,
and to the extent,
of his interest.

@node Parsing theory,  , Which chapters to read first, How to read this document
@section Parsing theory

This document also assumes an acquaintance
with parsing theory.
As a test of whether he needs to refresh
his knowledge before tackling
this document,
I hope the reader will find it helpful to
ask himself the
following list of questions.
@itemize @bullet
@item
What is a BNF rule?
@item
What is a Marpa sequence rule?
@item
As a reminder,
Marpa's sequence rules are implemented
as left recursions.
What does that mean?
@item
Take a Marpa sequence rule at random.
What does it look like when rewritten in BNF?
(Marpa sequences are implemented as left-recursions.)
@item
What does the sequence look like when rewritten
in BNF as a right-recursion?
@end itemize
For a reader to be satisfied with the level of detail
in the following pages,
he probably should be able to answer all the questions
in the above list after a moment of thought.

On the encouraging side,
while BNF has been overshadowed
by regular expressions, and is now considered
an advanced skill,
BNF is in fact as easy (or easier) to learn
and manipulation than regular expressions.
If a reader who has learned how to use
one of the packages that extend
regular expressions,
he should have no trouble with BNF.

@node About Libmarpa, Time objects, How to read this document, Top
@chapter About Libmarpa
This is the reference manual for Libmarpa.
Libmarpa implements the Marpa parsing algorithm.
Marpa is named
after the legendary 11th century Tibetan translator,
Marpa Lotsawa.
In creating Marpa,
I depended heavily on previous work by Jay Earley,
Joop Leo,
John Aycock and Nigel Horspool.

Libmarpa implements the entire Marpa algorithm.
This library does
the necessary grammar preprocessing, recognizes the input,
and produces parse trees.
It also supports the ordering and evaluation of the parse
trees.

However, it is very low-level.
Libmarpa, for example, has no strings.
Rules, symbols, and token values are all represented
by integers.
This, of course, will not suffice for most applications.
A user will almost always want,
at a minimum,
names for the symbols and non-integer values for
tokens.
Typically, an application will use arrays to
translate Libmarpa's integer IDs to strings or other
values as required.

Libmarpa also does NOT implement most of the semantics.
Libmarpa does have an evaluator, but it does NOT
manipulate the stack directly.
Instead, Libmarpa,
based on its traversal of the parse tree,
passes optimized step by step stack manipulation
instructions to the upper layer.
These instructions indicate the token or rule involved
involved,
and the proper location for the true token value or
the result of the rule evaluation.
For rule evaluations, the instructions include the stack location
of the arguments.

If all semantics are implemented in the application,
the application is in a much better position to prevent errors,
to catch them at runtime or
failing all else,
to successfully debug the logic.

@node Time objects, The architecture of Marpa, About Libmarpa, Top
@chapter Time objects

Libmarpa's most important objects are time objects.
Time objects are so called for two related reasons.
First, they relate to a "time" in the progress of a parse.
Second, each time object has a lifetime and is reference counted.

Libmarpa's major objects are called "time" objects instead
of phase objects,
because phases are exclusive and non-simultaneous
-- when one phase ends, another begins.
Time objects are often in use simultaneously.
In our lives, work and play are times.
Infancy, adolescent and adulthood are phases.

The time objects are, in sequence:
@itemize 
@item Grammars.
@item Recognizers.
@item Bocages.
@item Orderings.
@item Trees.
@item Valuators.
@end itemize

* The lifetime of time objects::  
@end menu

@node The sequence of time objects, Base grammars, Time objects, Time objects
@section The sequence of time objects

While time objects do not correspond to phases,
they do have a well-defined sequence.
Except for grammars,
all time objects are created from another time
object.
A recognizer cannot be created without a precomputed grammar;
a bocage cannot be created without a recognizer;
and so on.

@node Base grammars, The lifetime of time objects, The sequence of time objects, Time objects
@section Every time object has a base grammar

When one time object is used to create a second
time object,
the first time object is the @dfn{parent object}
and the second time object is the @dfn{child object}.
For example, when a bocage is created from a
recognizer,
the recognizer is the parent object,
and the bocage is the child object.

Grammars have no parent object.
Every other time object has exactly one parent object.
Valuation objects have no child objects.
All other time objects can have any number of children,
from zero up to a number determined by the memory limits
or the architecture.

Every time object has a @dfn{base grammar}.
A grammar object is its own base grammar.
The base grammar of a recognizer is the grammar
that it was created with.
The base grammar of any other time object is the base
grammar of its parent object.
For example,
the base grammar of a bocage is the base
grammar of the recognizer that it was created
with.

@node The lifetime of time objects,  , Base grammars, Time objects
@section The lifetime of time objects

Time objects are reference-counted.
Every time object is created with a reference count of 1.
Whenever one time object is created from another,
the parent time object has its reference count incremented
by 1.

Time objects do not have explicit destructors.
Every time object has a method which decrements its
reference count by 1.
When the reference count of a time object reaches
0, that time object is destroyed.

In ordinary circumstances, all an application has to
do is keep in mind that it "owns" the time objects
it has created,
and that it must call a method
to "unreference" that object when it is finished.

In some applications, multiple parts of it
may need to share ownership of an object.
For such situations,
every time object has a method to increment
the reference count.

@node Architecture - Grammar, Recognition versus parsing, The architecture of Marpa, The architecture of Marpa
@section Grammars

As per parsing theory,
before an input can be parsed,
a grammar must be defined.
Traditionally,
a grammar consists of a set of terminal symbols,
a set of non-terminal symbols,
a set of rules,
and a distinguished start symbol.

@menu
* Precomputation::              
@end menu

@node Precomputation,  , Architecture - Grammar, Architecture - Grammar
@subsection Precomputation

Before a recognizer can be created from a grammar,
it must be precomputed.
Internally, precomputation is what the term
suggests --
the memoization of a large number
of facts about the grammar to allow
the recognizer to proceed more efficiently.
Marpa makes aggressive use of grammar precomputation.

Precomputation "freezes" a grammar.
New symbols, rules and sequences cannot be added
to a precomputed grammar
are disallowed,
as are most other changes.

@node Recognition versus parsing,  , Architecture - Grammar, The architecture of Marpa
@section Recognition versus parsing

Even in the academic literature,
parsing is used in many senses,

Determining whether a string matches a grammar is called
@dfn{recognition}.
Finding the structure of the recognized string according
to the grammar is
@dfn{parsing} in a very strict sense of the term.
Strictly speaking,
Earley's algorithm was a recognizer,
and not a parser.
Marpa contains both a recognizer
and a parser in the strict sense.
Marpa's recognizer is implemented by its recognizer time objects.
Marpa's parser in the strict sense
is implemented by its bocage class and the classes
which follow the bocage in the time object sequence.

@node Threads, Numbered objects, The architecture of Marpa, Top
@chapter Threads

Libmarpa is C89-compliant
and uses no global data.
This means that it is thread-safe,
with restrictions.

@menu
* Grammars not shared between threads::  
* C89 and thread-safety::       
@end menu

@node Grammars not shared between threads, C89 and thread-safety, Threads, Threads
@section Grammars cannot be shared between threads
While Libmarpa can be used safely across
multiple threads,
a Libmarpa grammar cannot be.
Further, a Libmarpa time object can
only be used safely in the same thread
as its base grammar.
This is because all
time objects with the same base grammar share data
from that base grammar.

To work around this limitation,
the same grammar definition can be
used to a Libmarpa grammar
time object in each thread.
If there is sufficient interest, future versions of
Libmarpa could allow cloning of grammars and other
time objects.

@node C89 and thread-safety,  , Grammars not shared between threads, Threads
@section C89 and thread-safety
Libmarpa calls only routines defined in the C89 standard,
and in most modern implementations these are thread-safe.
But the C89 standard does not require thread-safety,
and even the most modern environments allow the user
to turn thread safety off.
Libmarpa's thread-safety relies on an environment
that quarantees the thread-safe of C89 function calls.

@node Numbered objects, Rule concepts, Threads, Top
@chapter Numbered objects

In addition to its major, "time" objects, Libmarpa also has
numbered objects
Examples of numbered objects are rules and symbols.
Numbered objects do not have lifetimes of their own.
Every numbered object belongs to a timed object,
and is destroyed with it.

@node Rule concepts, Symbol concepts, Numbered objects, Top
@chapter Rules

Rules are numbered objects.
At every point, where the rule count in @var{N},
there are rules numbered from 0 to @var{N}@minus{}1.
A rule is either external or internal.
An external rule is one intended to be visible
to the application.
An internal rule is one that the application
should only take note of, to the extent
that for the purpose of tracking rule numbers.
The application should not attempt to
alter internal rules.
The rules are never changed after precomputation.

Several methods associated with libmarpa's grammar
objects create rules.
This is documented with the method.
It is an implication of libmarpa's rule numbering
scheme,
that if the rule count was @var{X} before a method call,
and was @var{Y} after that call,
then the method call created @var{Y}@minus{}@var{X} rules,
numbered from @var{X} to @var{Y}@minus{}1.
At most one of these rules will be external,
and which rule that is will be indicated to
the application,
as described in the description of that method call.

@node Symbol concepts, Terminals concepts, Rule concepts, Top
@chapter Symbols

Symbols are numbered objects.
At every point, where the symbol count in @var{N},
there are symbols numbered from 0 to @var{N}@minus{}1.
A symbol is either external or internal.
An external symbol is one intended to be visible
to the application.
An internal symbol is one that the application
should only take note of, to the extent
that for the purpose of tracking symbol numbers.
The application should not attempt to
alter internal symbols.
The symbols are never changed after precomputation.

Several methods associated with libmarpa's grammar
objects create symbols.
This is documented with the method.
It is an implication of libmarpa's symbol numbering
scheme,
that if the symbol count was @var{X} before a method call,
and was @var{Y} after that call,
then the method call created @var{Y}@minus{}@var{X} symbols,
numbered from @var{X} to @var{Y}@minus{}1.
At most one of these symbols will be external,
and which symbol that is will be indicated to
the application,
as described in the description of that method call.

@node Terminals concepts, Semantics, Symbol concepts, Top
@chapter Terminals

A terminal symbol is symbol which
may appear in the input.
Traditionally,
all LHS symbols, as well as
the start symbol, must be non-terminals.
Marpa's grammars differ from the traditional ones
in that there is no necessary distinction between
terminals and non-terminals.
In Marpa,
a terminal may be the start symbol,
and may appear on the LHS of a rule.
However,
since terminals can never be zero length,
it is a logical contradiction for a nulling
symbol to also be a terminal
and Marpa does not allow it.

@menu
* LHS Terminals::               
@end menu

@node LHS Terminals,  , Terminals concepts, Terminals concepts
@section Uses for LHS terminals

Marpa's idea
in losing the sharp division between terminals
and non-terminals is that the distinction,
while helpful for proving theorems,
is not essential in practice.
If LHS symbols 
appear in the input they, in effect,
"short circuiting" the rules in which they occur.
This may
be helpful in debugging, or have other applications.

However,
it also can be useful, 
for checking input validity as well as for efficiency,
to follow tradition and distingush
non-terminals from terminals.
For this reason,
the traditional behavior is the default
in Marpa.

@menu
* Token values::                
@end menu

@node Token values,  , Semantics, Semantics
@section Token values

Token values are @code{int}'s.
Libmarpa does nothing with token values except accept
them from the application and return them during
parse evaluation.
Integers are used as token values instead of
pointers because their validity can be safely checked.
It is hard or impossible
to check the validity of pointers
without risking an abend.

Integers can be used to access any kind of data
using an array,
so that the higher levels can translate integers back
and forth into whatever the application requires.
A future version of Libmarpa may allow
pointer values,
for those circumstances in which some
programmers find that the minor
efficiencies from the direct use of pointers,
outweigh the safety
issues advanced by this author.

@node Version checking, Grammars, Semantics, Top
@chapter Checking the Libmarpa version
@cindex version checking

@deftypefun Marpa_Error_Code marpa_check_version @
    (unsigned int @var{required_major}, @
    unsigned int @var{required_minor}, @
    unsigned int @var{required_micro} @
    )

Checks that the Marpa library in use is compatible with the
given version. Generally you would pass in the constants
@code{MARPA_MAJOR_VERSION},
@code{MARPA_MINOR_VERSION},
@code{MARPA_MICRO_VERSION}
as the three arguments to this function; that produces
a check that the library in use is compatible with
the version of Libmarpa the application or module was compiled
against.

Once we are beyond alpha releases,
compatibility will be defined by three things:
first the version
of the running library is newer than the version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}.
Second
the running library must be binary compatible with the
version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}
(same major version.)

Currently Libmarpa is undergoing rapid development,
and backward compatibility is not maintained.
This will be the case as long as Libmarpa stays
alpha.

While Libmarpa is still alpha, much stricter compatibility
will be enforced.
While Libmarpa is alpha 
the major, minor and micro numbers must match exactly.
Technically, the post-alpha rules can be said to apply
because the very strict alpha rules imply them.

Return value: @code{MARPA_ERR_NONE} if the Marpa library is compatible with the
  requested version.  If the library is not compatible,
  one of @code{MARPA_ERR_MAJOR_VERSION_MISMATCH},
  @code{MARPA_ERR_MINOR_VERSION_MISMATCH} or
  @code{MARPA_ERR_MICRO_VERSION_MISMATCH}
  is returned, depending on the nature of the mismatch.

@deftypefun int marpa_g_symbol_is_internal (Marpa_Grammar @var{g}, @
    Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{symid})
A symbol is @dfn{internal} if it is one of those created
by libmarpa for its own internal uses.
Libmarpa controls the behavior of internal symbols,
and so that many operations are invalid for them.
For example, the user cannot set them to be terminals,
and they may be explicitly included in the LHS or RHS
of rules and sequences.

Return value: On success, 1 if symbol is internal, 0 if not.

A symbol is @dfn{nullable} if it sometimes produces the empty string.
A nulling symbol is always a nullable symbol,
but not all nullable symbols are nulling symbols.
This is not determined until the grammar is precomputed.

Return value: On success, 1 if symbol is nullable, 0 if not.

@deftypefunx int marpa_g_symbol_is_ask_me_when_null ( @

In Marpa,
most of the semantics is usually be implemented by the
higher layers.
This is called @dfn{"ask me" semantics}.
The "ask me when null"
calls deal with the handling of semantics
in case when the symbol is nulling.
For proper nullables,
the "Ask me when null" setting is relevant
only in cases where the symbol is nulled.

Marpa's default is to assume that the
value of nulled symbols will be ignored,
and to let that value be arbitrary.
"Arbitrary" here means it may not be relied
and may change from instance to instance.
Marpa optimizes for cases where symbols
have arbitrary values.

Return value: -2 if there was an error.
  On success, 1 if the resulting semantics after
  the function call is the "ask me" semantics.
  Otherise, 0 otherwise.

Creates a new external rule in grammar @var{g}.
The LHS symbol is @var{lhs},
and there are @var{length} symbols on the RHS,
which is pointed to by @var{rhs}.

An attempt to add a duplicate rule is a hard failure.
A rule is considered a duplicate if it has the same
LHS symbol,
and the same RHS symbols in the same order.

On success,
this call creates a new external rule,
whose ID is the return value.
No symbols or internal rules will be created.

The position in the rule, @var{ix}, is zero-based.
If @var{ix} is greater than or equal the length of the
rule, it is a soft failure.
This can be used in loops, to avoid having to determine
the rule's length explicitly.

Return value: On success, the symbol in position @var{ix}

Usually,
most of the semantics must be implemented by Marpa's
higher layers.
This is called @dfn{"ask me" semantics}.
In two special but common cases, however,
Marpa can implement the semantics internally,
eliminating an evaluation step.
This can be an considerable efficiency.

The two optimizable cases are "whatever semantics
and "first child" semantics.
If a rule has
@dfn{whatever semantics}, that means
that the higher layers
do not care about the value of the rule.
If a rule has
@dfn{first child semantics}, the value of the rule
should be the value of its first child node.
In the current implementation, both of these
can be implemented as stack no-ops.

In the current implementation,
first child semantics is equivalent to whatever semantics.
It is possible that a future implementation will
be unable to implement first child semantics as a stack
no-op.
At that point first child semantics will made equivalent
to "ask me" semantics.

Return value: -2 if there was an error.
  On success, 1 if the resulting semantics after
  the function call is the "ask me" semantics.
  Otherise, 0 otherwise.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_rule_is_accessible (Marpa_Grammar @var{g}, @
    Marpa_Rule_ID @var{id})
A rule is @dfn{accessible} if it can be reached from the start symbol.
This is not known until the grammar is precomputed.
A rule is accessible if and only if its LHS symbol is accessible.
The start rule is always an accessible rule.

Return value: On success, 1 if accessible, 0 if not.  If the grammar
is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_rule_is_productive (Marpa_Grammar @var{g}, @
    Marpa_Rule_ID @var{id})
A rule is @dfn{productive} if it can be produce a string of terminals.
including the empty string.
This is not known until the grammar is precomputed.
An rule is productive if and only if all the symbols on
its RHS are productive.
An empty rule is considered productive, vacuously.

Return value: On success, 1 if productive, 0 if not.  If the grammar
is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_rule_is_loop (Marpa_Grammar @var{g}, @
    Marpa_Rule_ID @var{rule_id})
A rule is a loop rule if it non-trivially
produces the string of length one
which consists only of its LHS symbol.
``Non-trivially'' means the zero-step derivation does not count -- the
derivation must have at least one step.

The presence of a loop rule makes a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and applications will typically want to treat them as fatal errors.
But nothing forces an application to do this,
and Marpa will successfully parse and evaluate grammars with
loop rules.

Return value: On success, 1 if this is a loop rule, 0 if not.  If the grammar
is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{rhs_id}, @
     Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{separator_id}, @
    int @var{min}, @
 int @var{flags} )
Adds a new sequence rule to grammar @var{g}.
Internally, Libmarpa translates sequences into BNF
rules, but it also optimizes their evaluation.
In practice this speedup can be considerable --
25% or more.

The sequence is @var{lhs_id},
and the item to be repeated in the sequence is @var{rhs_id}.
The sequence must be repeated at least @var{min} times,
where @var{min} is 0 or 1.
If @var{separator_id} is non-negative,
it is a separator symbol.

If @code{flags & MARPA_PROPER_SEPARATION} is non-zero,
separation is ``proper'', that is,
a trailing separator is not allowed.
The term @dfn{proper} is based on the idea that
properly-speaking, separators should actually separate items.

The sequence RHS, or item,
is restricted to a single symbol,
but almost arbitrary semantics can be expressed by having
@var{rhs_id} be the LHS of another rule.
A restrictions is that @var{rhs_id},
cannot be a nullable symbol.

If @var{separator_id} is a symbol, it also cannot
be a nullable symbol.
Nullables on the RHS of sequences are restricted
because they lead to highly ambiguous grammars.
Such grammars are allowed by Libmarpa, but
sequence optimizations would not work
for in the presence of nullables.
Also it is not clearly clear what
an application intends
when it asks for a sequence of items, some of which
may be null.
In such a case,
the user's intent is most clearly expressed
directly in BNF.

On success,
this call creates a new external rule,
whose ID is its return value.
It also creates zero or more internal rules,
and zero or more internal symbols.

Return value:  On success, the ID of the external rule.
If the rule duplicates another rule,

The separator symbol of a sequence rule is also considered
to be a counted symbol.

Return value: On success, 1 if the symbol is counted, 0 if not.

@section Precomputing the Grammar

@deftypefun int marpa_g_precompute (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})
This function precomputes the grammar.
In the process it may create one or more internal symbols,
and one or more internal rules.

In the process, precomputation creates events which
the user can access.
On success, this function returns the number of events
generated,
but it is important to note that events may be
created whether precomputation fails or succeeds.
Applications which fail must call @code{marpa_g_event}
if they want to determine if any events occurred.
Since the reason for failure to precompute is often
detailed in the events, failed applications will often
be at least as interested in the events as those
which succeeded.

Each @code{MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES} event is a rule
which is part of an cycle (infinite loop) in the grammar.
Cycles 
are useless in current (and currently foreseen)
practice.
Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous
and their presence makes processing the grammar less
efficient, sometimes considerably so.
Nonetheless, they are not errors,
although most applications will wish to treat them
as such.

Each @code{MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE} event is a symbol
which is a nullable on the right hand side of a sequence
rule -- a ``counted'' symbol.
The presence of one or more of these is a fatal error.
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
the failure is delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

Each @code{MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL} event is a nulling
symbol which is also flagged as a terminal.
Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical
impossibility, and
the presence of one or more of these is a fatal error.
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
the failure is delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

Precomputation involves freezing 
and then thoroughly checking the grammar,
and it is at this point that many hard errors
are caught and reported.
Counted nullables and nulling terminals have
already been mentioned.
Grammars without rules and those
with invalid start symbols also produce
hard errors.

Return value: On success, the number of events generated.
If the grammar is already precomputed,
or on other failure, -2.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_is_precomputed (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_has_cycle (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})
This function allows the application to determine if grammar
@var{g} has a cycle.
As mentioned, most applications will want to treat these
as fatal errors.
To determine which rules are in the cycle,
@var{marpa_g_rule_is_loop} can be used.

0 otherwise.
On failure, -2.

@section About the valuator
While Libmarpa passes instruction for stack manipulation,
it does not actually maintain a stack.
This leaves the upper layer in total control of the
stack and the values which are placed on it.

As example may make this clearer.
Suppose the evalution is at a place in the parse tree
where an addition is being performed.
Libmarpa does not know that the operation
is an addition.
It will tell the application that rule number R
is to be applied to the arguments at stack locations
N and N+, and that the result is to placed in
stack location N.

In this system,
The application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule R and determines that it
is an addition.
The application can do this by using R as an index
into an array of callbacks, or by any other method
it chooses.
Let's assume a callback implements the semantics
for rule R.
Libmarpa has told the application that two arguments
are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations N and N+1 in the stack.
They might be the numbers 42 and 711.
So the callback is called with its two arguments,
and produces a return value, let's say, 753.
Libmarpa has told the application that the result
belongs at location N in the stack,
so the application writes 752 to location N.

Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics,
the operation for rule R could be string concatenation
instead of addition.
Or, if it is addition, it could allow for its arguments
to be floating point or complex numbers.
Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers,
strings, complex numbers; or objects which may be any
or all of these and more.

This technique
hides Libmarpa's grammar rewrites from the application,
and is actually quite efficient.
Libmarpa knows which rules are sequences
and optimizes stack manipulations based on this knowledge.
Many practical grammars use long sequences heavily,
and for these Libmarpa the series of steps
suggest by Libmarpa will be significantly faster than the standard 
stack evaluation algorithm in the textbooks.

To make it clear,
I am under no illusion that Libmarpa's evaluator will be found
satisfactory even to most application programmers.
I certainly avoid using it directly.
It is intended to be used via an upper layer,
one which does know about semantics.

But, by isolating Libmarpa from semantics, Libmarpa avoids
imposing any arbitrary restrictions on the semantics used
with the Marpa algorithm.
To see the advantage suppose, as I expect will often be the case,
Libmarpa is used as the basis
for a higher-level language which needs callbacks in that higher level language.
For generality, Libmarpa would have to deal in C callback,
which wrapper the callbacks in the higher level language.
This is complex to code and inefficient,
but that is not its worst aspect.
The worst aspect happens when there is a programming error.
This error will occur inside Libmarpa,
and inside code about which Libmarpa can make no assumptions.

@chapter Error handling

@section Soft and hard errors

Soft errors are errors which may be a result of normal processing.
Soft errors often do not disrupt the flow of processing,
and applications typically do not treat soft errors
as fatal errors.
When a soft error is an interruption of normal processing,
the disruption is usually recoverable.

Hard errors are errors which are never the result of
normal processing.
They almost always disrupt the flow of processing.
Recovery from a hard error is usually not possible,
and an application will usually treat a hard error
as a fatal error.

The difference between hard and soft errors can
depend, to a certain extent,
on the application.
Libmarpa has its own idea of what is a hard
and soft error but,
whenever possible,
it does not enforce this on the application.
An application is also free to treat a soft
error as a hard error.
And Libmarpa makes
every attempt to allow an application to
reinterpret a hard error as a soft error.

A "counted" symbol is also a nullable symbol.
A "counted" symbol is one that appears on the RHS
of a sequence rule.
If a symbol is nullable,
counting occurrences of it,
which is what sequence rules do for their RHS
symbols,
becomes very difficult.
All sorts of questions of definition and
problems of implementation arise.
At a minimum, such a sequence would be wildly
ambigious.

Sequence rules are simply an optimized shorthand

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_DEVELOPMENT
The "development" errors is for use during
Libmarpa's development,
while it is not yet clear how precisely
to classify every error condition.
The error string is a
short 7-bit ASCII error string
which describes the error.
Classifying an error as "development"
is a temporary measure,
taken until the error can be more
precisely defined and classed.
Suggested message: "Development error, see string."

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_RULE
This error indicates an attempt to add a rule which
is a duplicate of a rule already in the grammar.
Two rules are considered duplicates if

@itemize @bullet
@item
Both rules have the same left hand symbol.
@item
Both rules have the same right hand symbols in the same order.

This definition applies to sequence rules, as well as to ordinary rules. As a consequence, sequence rules can be considered duplicates even when they have different separators and/or different minimum counts.
Suggested message: "Duplicate rule."

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_EIM_COUNT
Libmarpa allows a maximum number of earley
items per Earley set.
This error code indicates that limit was
exceeded.
Note that this limit is different from
the optional earley item
warning threshold, which can be set
by the application.
Exceeding the warning threshold causes
a Libmarpa event, which the application
is free to treat as a hard or soft error.
Suggested message: "Maximum number of earley items exceeded."

Most likely, memory will run out for
other reasons long before this error can
occur.
The maximum earley item count for the
purposes of this error code
is over a billion.
As a contrast, a reasonable setting for the
warning threshold,
even when exceeding the threshold is
treated as a fatal error,
will usually be well under 1000.
If this error code ever does occur,
it is almost certainly both a hard and a 
fatal error.

@section Why so many time objects?

Readers accustomed to other appraoches to parsing,
particular those in fashion at this writing,
may wonder on the number of time objects
in the Marpa architecture.
Several of Marpa's time objects (bocages,
orderings and trees) are required
because Marpa allows,
and offers powerful tools for dealing with,
ambigious grammars.

It may seem, then, that users of unambiguous grammars,
are paying a considerable price in time effiency
for the ability to parse
ambiguous ones.
This is not the case.
In the trivial case, the cost of the orderings
object is a single, very brief, subroutine call.

Bocage objects come at minimal cost,
because the same pass which creates the bocage
also deals with other issues which are of major
significance even for unambiguous parses.
The same pass which creates the bocage
enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.

Tree objects come at mininal cost to unambiguous grammars,
because the same pass that allows iteration through multiple
parse trees does the tree traversal, so that the valuation time object
has very litle to do -- it just steps through the sequence.

But what about the many passes over the data this requires?
Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.
Marpa achieves its efficiency,
not in spite of making multiple
passes over the data, but because of it.
Marpa is @math{O(n)} for LR-regular grammars,
both in theory and in implementation,
because Marpa regularly substitutes
two fast @math{O(n)} passes for a single
@math{O(n log n)} pass.

@node Design of numbered objects,  , Why so many time objects, Design considerations
@section Numbered objects

As the name suggests,
the choice was made to implement
numbered objects and not as
pointers.
Integers can be easily and safely checked for validity,
while pointer cannot.

There are efficiency tradeoffs between pointers and
integers but they are complications and go both ways.
Pointers can be faster, but integers can be used
as indexes into more than one data structure.
Which is actually faster depends on the design.
Integers allow for a more flexible design,
so that once the choice is settled on,
careful programming can make them a win,
possibly a very big one.

The approach taken in Libmarpa was to settle
from the outset,
on integers as the implementation for numbered
objects and optimize on that basis.
In any case, the difference is speed on
modern architectures is
a small price to pay for
safe, portable validity checking.
