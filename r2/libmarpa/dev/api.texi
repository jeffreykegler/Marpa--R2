@section How to read this document

This is essentially a reference document,
but its early chapters lay out concepts
essential to the others.
Readers will usually want to read the
chapters up and including
@ref{Introduction to the external interface}
in order.
Otherwise, they may follow their interests.

@node Prerequisites, Parsing theory, How to read this document, About this document
@section Prerequisites

This document is very far from self-contained.
It assumes the following:
@itemize
@item
The reader knows the C programming language
at least well
enough to understand function prototypes.
@item
The reader
has read the documents for one of Libmarpa's upper layers.
@item
The reader knows some parsing theory.
@xref{Parsing theory}.
@end itemize

@node Parsing theory,  , Prerequisites, About this document
@section Parsing theory

This document assumes an acquaintance
with parsing theory.
As a test of whether he needs to refresh
his knowledge before tackling
this document,
I hope the reader will find it helpful to
ask himself the
following list of questions.
@itemize @bullet
@item
What is a BNF rule?
@item
What is a Marpa sequence rule?
@item
As a reminder,
Marpa's sequence rules are implemented
as left recursions.
What does that mean?
@item
Take a Marpa sequence rule at random.
What does it look like when rewritten in BNF?
@item
What does the sequence look like when rewritten
in BNF as a right-recursion?
@end itemize
For a reader to be satisfied with the level of detail
in the following pages,
he probably should be able to answer all the questions
in the above list after a moment of thought.

On the encouraging side,
while BNF has been overshadowed
by regular expressions, and is now considered
an advanced skill,
BNF is in fact as easy (or easier) to learn
and manipulation than regular expressions.
If a reader has learned how to use
one of the packages that extend
regular expressions,
he should have no trouble with BNF.

@node About Libmarpa, Architecture, About this document, Top
@chapter About Libmarpa
Libmarpa implements the Marpa parsing algorithm.
Marpa is named
after the legendary 11th century Tibetan translator,
Marpa Lotsawa.
In creating Marpa,
I depended heavily on previous work by Jay Earley,
Joop Leo,
John Aycock and Nigel Horspool.

Libmarpa implements the entire Marpa algorithm.
This library does
the necessary grammar preprocessing, recognizes the input,
and produces parse trees.
It also supports the ordering, iteration
and evaluation of the parse
trees.

Libmarpa is very low-level.
For example, it has no strings.
Rules, symbols, and token values are all represented
by integers.
This, of course, will not suffice for most applications.
A user will almost always want,
at a minimum,
names for the symbols and non-integer values for
tokens.
Typically, an application will use arrays to
translate Libmarpa's integer ID's to strings or other
values as required.

Libmarpa also does @strong{not} implement most of the semantics.
Libmarpa does have an evaluator (called a ``valuator''),
but it does @strong{not}
manipulate the stack directly.
Instead, Libmarpa,
based on its traversal of the parse tree,
passes optimized step by step stack manipulation
instructions to the upper layer.
These instructions indicate the token or rule involved,
and the proper location for the true token value or
the result of the rule evaluation.
For rule evaluations, the instructions include the stack location
of the arguments.

Marpa requires most semantics to be
implemented in the application.
This allows the application total flexibility.
It also puts
the application is in a much better position to prevent errors,
to catch errors at runtime or,
failing all else,
to successfully debug the logic.

@node Time objects, The lifetime of time objects, Architecture, Architecture
@section Time objects

Marpa divides parsing into phases,
which in this document are more often called ``times''.
The term ``time'' is more accurate,
beacuse the time objects are typically in use simultaneously.
The term ``phase'' suggest a time which is
exclusive and non-simultaneous
-- when one phase ends, another begins.
In our lives, work and play are times.
Infancy, adolescent and adulthood are phases.

Although times can be simulataneous,
they do have a sequence.
The times are, in sequence order:

@itemize
@item
Grammar:  At grammar time, the rules and symbols
are defined, with their properties.
A grammar must be precomputed before a recognizer can
be created from it.
@item
Recognizer: At recognizer time, input is read.
@item
Bocage: At bocage time, a data structure called a
bocage is created from the information captured
during recognition.
The bocage stores a collection of parse trees,
similar to a parse forest.
@item
Ordering: At ordering time, a order is defined
for the bocage.
@item
Tree: At tree time,
an iterator of the parse bocage
is created, and traversed.
@item
Value: At value time,
the current parse tree of a tree iterator
is traversed for its ``steps''.
``Steps'' are instructions that tell
the application how to maintain
a stack and to evaluate the
semantics.
@end itemize

The time objects classes have one letter abbreviations,
which are used frequently.
These are, in the standard sequence,

@itemize
@item
Grammar:  G
@item
Recognizer: R
@item
Bocage: B
@item
Ordering: O
@item
Tree: T
@item
Value: V
@end itemize

@node The lifetime of time objects, Parent and child time objects, Time objects, Architecture
@section The lifetime of time objects

One of reasons Libmarpa's major objects
are called ``time objects''
is that each of them has a distinct lifetime.
Time objects are reference counted.
Every time object is created with a reference count of 1.
Whenever one time object is created from another,
the parent time object has its reference count incremented
by 1.

Time objects do not have explicit destructors.
When the reference count of a time object reaches
0, that time object is destroyed.
When a child object is destroyed, it
decrements the reference count of its parent.
Also, each time class has a method that decrements 
the reference count of an object in that class by 1.

In ordinary circumstances, all an application has to
do is keep in mind that it ``owns'' the time objects
it has created,
and that it must call a method
to ``unreference'' that object when it is finished.

More complex applications may find it convenient
to have multiple parts, or even new objects,
that share ownership of a Libmarpa time object.
For such situations,
every class of time object has a method to increment
the reference count for objects in that class.

@node Parent and child time objects, Numbered objects, The lifetime of time objects, Architecture
@section Parent and child time objects

Except for grammars,
all time objects are created from another time
object.
Each time object is created from a time object
of the class before it in the sequence.
A recognizer cannot be created without a precomputed grammar;
a bocage cannot be created without a recognizer;
and so on.

When one time object is used to create a second
time object,
the first time object is the @dfn{parent object}
and the second time object is the @dfn{child object}.
For example, when a bocage is created from a
recognizer,
the recognizer is the parent object,
and the bocage is the child object.

Grammars have no parent object.
Every other time object has exactly one parent object.
Value objects have no child objects.
All other time objects can have any number of children,
from zero up to a number determined by memory or
some other machine-determined limit.

Every time object has a @dfn{base grammar}.
A grammar object is its own base grammar.
The base grammar of a recognizer is the grammar
that it was created with.
Similarly,
the base grammar of any other time object is the base
grammar of its parent object.
For example,
the base grammar of a bocage is the base
grammar of the recognizer that it was created
with.

@node Numbered objects,  , Parent and child time objects, Architecture
@section Numbered objects

In addition to its major, ``time'' objects, Libmarpa also has
numbered objects.
Numbered objects do not have lifetimes of their own.
Every numbered object belongs to a timed object,
and is destroyed with it.
Rules and symbols are numbered objects.
Tokens values are another class of numbered
objects.

@node The traditional model, The earleme variables, Earlemes, Earlemes
@subsection The traditional model

In traditional Earley parsers, the concept of location is very simple.
Locations are numbered from 0 to @math{n}, where @math{n} is the length of
the input.
Every location has an Earley set, and vice versa.
Location 0 is the start location.
Every location after the start location has exactly one input token
associated with it.

Already some applications
do not fit this traditional input model -- 
natural language processing requires ambiguous tokens,
for example.
Libmarpa's allows a wide variety of alternative input models.

This document assumes that the reader knows the concepts
behind Libmarpa's
alternative input models, either from the documentation
of a higher level interface, such as
@code{Marpa::XS} or
@code{Marpa::R2},
or from Marpa's
@uref{https://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa-theory/recce.pdf, theory document}.

As a reminder,
in Libmarpa a location is called a @dfn{earleme}.
The number of an Earley set is the @dfn{ID of the Earley set},
or its @dfn{ordinal}.
In the traditional model, the ordinal of an Earley set and
its earleme are always exactly the same, but in Libmarpa
they will be different.

@node The earleme variables, The significances of the earleme variables, The traditional model, Earlemes
@subsection The earleme variables

The important earleme variables are the current, the furthest and
the latest earleme.
The @dfn{current earleme} is the earleme that Libmarpa is currently working on.
More specifically, it is the one at which new tokens will @strong{start}.
Since tokens are never zero length, a new token will always end after the
current earleme.
The current earleme is initially earleme 0.
Every call to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} advances the
current earleme by 1.

The @dfn{furthest earleme} is the highest numbered (and therefore ``furthest'')
earleme at which a token ends.
The furthest earleme is initially earleme 0.
With every call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}, the end of the token
it adds is calculated.
A token ends at earleme @var{end_earleme} = @var{current}+@var{length},
where @var{current} is the current earleme,
and @var{length} is the length of the newly added token.
After a call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()},
the furthest earleme is its value before the call,
or @var{end_earleme}, whichever is greater.

The @dfn{latest earleme} is the earleme of the latest
Earley set.
The @dfn{latest Earley set} is the last Earley set completed.
This is always the highest numbered Earley set.
If there is an Earley set at the current earleme,
it is the latest Earley set and the latest earleme
is equal to the current earleme.
There is never an Earley set after the current earleme.
If there is no Earley set at the current earleme,
the latest Earley set,
which is also the highest numbered Earley set,
is the last one completed.

After every call to the @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} method
that adds a token,
the value of the latest earleme is 
same as the value of the current earleme.
After every call to the @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} method
that does @strong{not} add a token,
the value of the lastest earleme is unchanged
from its value before the call.

@node The significances of the earleme variables, The initial earleme settings, The earleme variables, Earlemes
@subsection The significances of the earleme variables

The current earleme tracks the advance of the recognizer through the input.
Input tokens always start at the current earleme.
An application can advance past the current earleme,
by calling @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}, which
increments the current earleme by 1.
After initialization,
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} is
the only way to manipulate the value of the current earleme.

The furthest earleme tracks how ``far out'' tokens can be found.
In the standard input model, calling 
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} after each
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} call is sufficient to process
all inputs,
and the furthest earleme's value
can be typically be ignored.
In alternative input models, if tokens have lengths greater than
1, calling
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} once after the last token
is read may not be enough to ensure that all tokens have been processed.
To ensure that all tokens have been processed,
an application must advance the current earleme
by calling @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
until the current earleme is equal to the furthest earleme.

The lastest earleme is the earleme of the last Earley set.
The latest earleme is different from the current earleme if and only if
there is no Earley set at the current earleme.
Once recognition is complete, parsing must take place over
a range of Earley sets.
A different end of parsing can be specified,
but by default, parsing is of the input
from earleme 0 to the latest earleme.

@node The initial earleme settings, The standard model of input, The significances of the earleme variables, Earlemes
@subsection The initial earleme settings

Understanding the
settings of current, latest and furthest earleme is
crucial to working with advanced input models,
and for this reason the next sections will go
through the possibilities carefully.
The presentation will start with the most traditional
and restrictive models.
It will proceed to less restrictive models.

All input models have the same initial values.
Initially the current, latest and furthest earleme
are always earleme 0.

@node The standard model of input, Ambiguous input, The initial earleme settings, Earlemes
@subsection The standard model of input

In the standard model of input,
Calls to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
and @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} are
made in pairs.
There is first exactly one call 
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
for a token with length 1.
Following it must be a call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
For an input of length @var{n}, there will be
exactly @var{n} such paired calls.

In the standard model,
for each call to 
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
if the current earleme before the call was @var{i},
then after the call
the latest earleme will also be @var{i},
and the furthest earleme will be @var{i}+1.
For each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
if the current earleme before the call was @var{i},
then after the call
the latest earleme,
the furthest earleme,
and the current earleme
will all be @var{i}+1.

@node Ambiguous input, Variable length tokens, The standard model of input, Earlemes
@subsection Ambiguous input

As a first loosening of the standard model,
we no longer require calls to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
to be paired with calls to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
Instead,
we allow multiple calls
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
before each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
We still require that there be at least one call
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
before each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
and we still require that all tokens have 
a length of 1.
In this model, the behavior of the current,
latest and furthest earlemes are exactly
as described for the standard model.

@node Variable length tokens, The generalized model, Ambiguous input, Earlemes
@subsection Variable length tokens

Our next loosening of the restrictions is to allow
variable length tokens.
That is, instead of requiring that all tokens
be of length 1,
we allow tokens to be of length 1 or longer.
This does change the behavior of the earleme variables.

In this new model,
for each call to 
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
if the current earleme before the call was @var{i},
then after the call
the latest earleme will also be @var{i},
but the furthest earleme will be MAX(@var{f'}, @var{i}+@var{length}),
where @var{f'} is the value of the furthest earleme before the call,
and @var{length} is the length of the token.
That is, the new value of the furthest earleme will
be its previous value,
or the end earleme of the newly added token,
whichever is greater.

For each call to 
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
if the current earleme before the call was @var{i},
then after the call
the current earleme and latest earleme will both be @var{i+1}.
The furthest earleme is never changed by a call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} --
it will have the same value it had before the call.

@node The generalized model, General rules for the earleme variables, Variable length tokens, Earlemes
@subsection The generalized model

To fully generalize the input model,
we now need to remove only one restriction.
We now allow empty earlemes -- earlemes with
no tokens and no Earley set.

A call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
creates an empty earleme if and only if
it falls into one of these two cases:
@itemize
@item
There has been no call
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()} since
recognizer initialization.
@item
There has been no call
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()} since
the previous call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
@end itemize

If a call to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} creates
an empty earleme,
the latest earleme remains unchanged from its
prior value.
This means that, since the current earleme will
change, the latest earleme will be less
than the current earleme.
As always the furthest earleme is unchanged by
the call to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.

@node General rules for the earleme variables,  , The generalized model, Earlemes
@subsection General rules for the earleme variables

At this point, the most generalized input model has been
introduced.
Next we state some facts that will always be the case,
no matter what input model is in use.

@itemize
@item The current earleme is greater than
or equal to the latest earleme.
@item The furthest earleme is greater than
or equal to the latest earleme.
@item If the parser is not exhausted,
the furthest earleme is always greater than
or equal to the current earleme.
@item In an exhausted parser,
the furthest earleme is always less than
or equal to the current earleme.
@item If the furthest earleme is greater than the current earleme,
the parser is not exhausted.
@item For the furthest earleme to be less than the current earleme,
the parser must be exhausted.
@end itemize

@node Terminals, LHS Terminals, Earlemes, Input
@section Terminals

A terminal symbol is a symbol which
may appear in the input.
Traditionally,
all LHS symbols, as well as
the start symbol, must be non-terminals.
Marpa's grammars differ from the traditional ones
in that there is no necessary distinction between
terminals and non-terminals.
In Marpa,
a terminal may be the start symbol,
and may appear on the LHS of a rule.
However,
since terminals can never be zero length,
it is a logical contradiction for a nulling
symbol to also be a terminal
and Marpa does not allow it.

in losing the sharp division between terminals
and non-terminals is that the distinction,
while helpful for proving theorems,
is not essential in practice.
If LHS symbols
appear in the input they, in effect,
``short circuiting'' the rules in which they occur.
This may
be helpful in debugging, or have other applications.

However,
it also can be useful,
for checking input validity as well as for efficiency,
to follow tradition and distingush
non-terminals from terminals.
For this reason,
the traditional behavior is the default
in Marpa.

@node Token values,  , LHS Terminals, Input
@section Token values

Token values are @code{int}'s.
Libmarpa does nothing with token values except accept
them from the application and return them during
parse evaluation.
Integers are used as token values instead of
pointers because their validity can be safely checked.
It is hard or impossible
to check the validity of pointers
without risking an abend.
Integers can be used to access any kind of data
using an array,
so that the higher levels can translate integers back
and forth into whatever the application requires.

@section How the Libmarpa semantics work

Libmarpa handling of semantics is unusual.
Most semantics are left up to the application,
but Libmarpa guides them.
Specifically, the application is expected to maintain the evaluation
stack.
Libmarpa's valuator provides instructions on how to handle the stack.
Libmarpa's stack handling instructions
are called ``steps''.
For example, a Libmarpa step might tell the application that the value
of a token needs to go into a certain stack position.
Or a Libmarpa step might tell the application that a rule is to be evaluation.
For rule evalution, Libmarpa will tell the application where the operands
are to be found,
and where the result must go.

@node Universe of values, Valued and unvalued symbols, How Libmarpa semantics work, Semantics
@section The universe of values

The application can react to Libmarpa's stack handling instructions
in any way it sees fit,
but it is expected that it will maintain a physical stack which
can be addressed as an array.

An advantage of leaving the application in control of the stack
is that the applicaion has total control over what the stack values
are.
The set of all possible stack values is the application's
@dfn{universe of values}.
For example, as implemented in Perl,
the universe of values is the Perl scalar-assignables.
In C, they could be integers, @code{void *} pointers,
or pointers to some sort of polymorphic object.

It is up to the application to make sure the stack positions
in Libmarpa's steps exist and are initialized as desired
by the application.
This means extending the stack as needed for writes,
but also for reads.
Because of optimizations, it is quite possible for a
Libmarpa step to identify a stack position which has
never been written to as the operand of a rule.
This can happen, for example, if the rule's
operand is an unvalued or ``whatever''
value.
(It is expected that in such a case that the rule's value
does not depend on that operand, though it is up to the
application to ensure this.)

C programmers should be aware of a pitfalls specific to C.
Both C90 and C99 allow unitialized values to be ``trap'' values --
values which cause a trap (possibly an abend) when read.
A C application must take steps to ensure either that
the universe of values does not include trap values,
or that these trap values are never read.
Excluding trap values from a C program's universe of
values may require the application to make
sure that stack positions are properly initialized.
This is discussed in detail in the section
on value objects.
@xref{Value methods}.

@node Valued and unvalued symbols,  , Universe of values, Semantics
@section Valued and unvalued symbols

Libmarpa symbols can have values,
which is the traditional way of doing semantics.
Libmarpa also allows symbols to be unvalued.
An @dfn{unvalued} symbol is one whose value
is unpredictable from instance to instance.
If a symbol is unvalued, we sometimes say that it
has ``whatever'' semantics.

Situations where the semantics can tolerate unvalued symbols
are surprisingly frequent.
For example, the top-level of many languages is a series
of major units, all of whose semantics are typically accomplished
via side effects.
The compiler is typically indifferent to the actual value produced
by these major units, and tracking them is a waste of time.
Similarly, the value of the separators in a list is typically
ignored.

Rules are unvalued if and only if their LHS symbols
are unvalued.
When rules and symbols are unvalued,
Libmarpa optimizes their evaluation.

It is in principle unsafe to check the value 
of a symbol if it can be unvalued.
For this reason,
once a symbol has been treated as valued,
Libmarpa marks it as valued.
Similarly,
once a symbol has been treated as unvalued,
Libmarpa marks it as unvalued.
Once marked, a symbol's valued status is
@dfn{locked} and cannot be changed later.

The valued status of terminals is marked the first
time they are read.
The valued status of LHS symbols must be explicitly
marked by the application when initializing the
valuator -- this is Libmarpa's equivalent of
registering a callback.

LHS terminals are disabled by default.
If allowed, the user should be aware that the valued
status of a LHS terminal
will be locked in the recognizer
if it is used as a terminal,
and the symbol's use as a rule LHS
in the valuator must be
consistent with the recognizer's marking.

Marpa reports an error when a symbol's use
conflicts with its locked valued status.
Doing so usually saves the programmer
some tricky debugging further down the road.
But it is possible that an application might deliberately
want to mix
valued and unvalued uses of a symbol -- an application
might be able to differentiate them using the larger
context, or might be tolerant of the uncertainty.
If there is interest,
a future Libmarpa extension might allow a locked
valued status to be overriden.

@node Threads, Error handling concepts, Semantics, Top
@chapter Threads

Libmarpa is thread-safe,
given circumstances as described below.
The Libmarpa methods are not reentrant.

Libmarpa is C89-compliant.
It uses no global data,
and calls only the routines
that are defined in the C89 standard
and that can be made thread-safe.
In most modern implementations,
the default C89 implementation is thread-safe
to the extent possible.
But the C89 standard does not require thread-safety,
and even most modern environments allow the user
to turn thread safety off.
To be thread-safe, Libmarpa must be compiled
and linked in an environment that provides
thread-safety.

While Libmarpa can be used safely across
multiple threads,
a Libmarpa grammar cannot be.
Further, a Libmarpa time object can
only be used safely in the same thread
as its base grammar.
This is because all
time objects with the same base grammar share data
from that base grammar.

To work around this limitation,
the same grammar definition can be
used to a create a new
Libmarpa grammar
time object in each thread.
If there is sufficient interest, future versions of
Libmarpa could allow thread-safe
cloning of grammars and other
time objects.

@node Memory allocation failures, Success and failure, Error handling concepts, Error handling concepts
@section Memory allocation failures

Libmarpa leaves the decision of what is a fatal
error up to the application,
with one exception.
Currently, if @code{malloc} fails to allocate memory,
Libmarpa terminates the program with a fatal error.

While this is in keeping with current practice,
future versions of Libmarpa are likely to both allow
an alternative memory allocator to be specificied,
and to allow the user to specifier a handler to
be called when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

@node Success and failure, Soft and hard failure., Memory allocation failures, Error handling concepts
@section Success and failure

In this document, success and failure are (unless
the context makes it clear otherwise) used in a special, technical
sense, one which may differ from the usual one.
In ordinary language, ``success'' is a desired result,
and ``failure'' an undesired one.

In this document, @dfn{success}
means that Libmarpa
followed its primary logic path to its end,
returning the result appropriate for that logic path.
@dfn{Failure} means some other logic path was followed.

As one example where the distinction is relevant,
some methods are designed so that they can be used
to control a loop.  Success means continue the loop,
while a soft failure indicates that the loop should terminate.
It is typically a good thing for loops to terminate,
so that this soft failure is,
in context,
very much a ``desired result''.
As another example,
the ``Ruby Slippers'' parsing method uses soft failures
as a means of testing alternative inputs and/or
checking the state of the parse.

@node Soft and hard failure.,  , Success and failure, Error handling concepts
@section Soft and hard failure.

Some methods have, in addition to a primary logic path,
a secondary one.
If a result is returned from a secondary logic path,
that is a soft failure.
As previously stated, a soft failure may be,
in the ordinary sense of the word ``failure'',
no failure at all but very much a desired
and expected result.

All methods have a primary logic path,
but for some methods no logic path is distinguished
as the ``secondary'' one.
These methods never return a soft failure.
A hard failure results when a method returns a value
from some logic path other than the primary or secondary
one.

Whenever a method returns a hard failure,
Libmarpa sets the error code to indicate
the nature of the failure.
Soft failures typically have a single
cause, and usually are indicated by a return
value special to soft failures,
and in those cases an error code is not needed.
In the cases where it is not
necessary,
the error code is not set.

An application will have its own ideas of success,
of what is or is not a recoverable failure,
and of what is or is not a fatal error.
As much as possible, Libmarpa makes it
possible for the application to capture
its results and reinterpret them to suit
the application's purpose.

Because of the variability of applications, there are no hard and
fast rules.  However, if taken with a grain of salt, a few
generalizations may be helpful.  Soft failures disrupt the normal
flow of processing less often than hard failures.  Hard failures
only rarely are part of an application's primary logic path, and
very often indicate an unrecoverable error.
There are many cases in which
soft failures are part of an application's primary logic path,
even more where they are part of a secondary logic path,
and even more where they are recoverable.
But it is also true that many
soft failures are unrecoverable errors from the point of view of
the application.

@section  About the overviews

The reference method sections usually begin with an overview
describing the important methods.
These sections can be describe the
most important Libmarpa methods,
in the order in which they are typically used,
and can be used as ``cheat sheet''.

The overview sections limit themselves to
the most important methods.
To guide the reader to those methods
that he is most likely to find essential
for his application,
the overview sections often speak of
an ``archetypal'' application.
The archetypal Libmarpa application
implements the complete logic flow,
from the creation of a grammar to a final result
from its valuation.
In the archetypal Libmarpa application,
the grammar, input and semantics are small but non-trivial.

@node Return values, Naming conventions, About the overviews, Introduction to the external interface
@section Return values

If a function returns an integer value,
and it is not otherwise stated,
-1 indicates a soft failure,
-2 indicates a hard failure
and a non-negative result indicates success.
If a function returns an pointer value,
and it is not otherwise stated,
@code{NULL} indicates a failure,
and any other result indicates success.

Exceptions to these rules
will be explicitly indicated.
Where a method returns @code{NULL},
and in its description
there is no mention of soft failure,
the reader can assume that the method never
returns soft failure.
If a method allows soft failure,
the cause of the soft failure will always be described,
either in the description of a -1 return,
or explicitly.

Hard failure often can have many causes,
and full descriptions of all of them under each
method would hopelessly
clutter the method descriptions.
The Libmarpa error code is always set after
a hard failure,
and a full descriptions of the causes of each
error code is in its own section.
@xref{External error codes}.

@node Naming conventions,  , Return values, Introduction to the external interface
@section Naming conventions

Methods in Libmarpa follow a strict naming convention.
All methods have a name beginning with @code{marpa_},
if they are part of the
external interface.
If an external method is not a static method,
its name is prefixed with one of 
@code{marpa_g_},
@code{marpa_r_},
@code{marpa_b_},
@code{marpa_o_},
@code{marpa_t_} or
@code{marpa_v_},
where the single letter between underscores
is one of the time class abbreviations.
The letter indicates which class
the method belongs to.

Methods which are exported,
but which are part of
the internal interface begin with @code{_marpa_}.
Methods which are part of the internal interface
(hereafter ``internal methods'')
are subject to change and are intended for use
only by Libmarpa's developers.

Libmarpa reserves the @code{marpa_}
and @code{_marpa_} prefixes for itself,
with all their capitalization variants.
All Libmarpa names visible outside the package
will begin with a capitalization variant
of one of these two prefixes.

    (unsigned int @var{required_major}, @
    unsigned int @var{required_minor}, @

    )

Checks that the Marpa library in use is compatible with the
given version. Generally you would pass in the constants
@code{MARPA_MAJOR_VERSION},
@code{MARPA_MINOR_VERSION},
@code{MARPA_MICRO_VERSION}
as the three arguments to this function; that produces
a check that the library in use is compatible with
the version of Libmarpa the application or module was compiled
against.

Currently Libmarpa is undergoing rapid development,
and backward compatibility is not maintained.
This will be the case as long as Libmarpa stays
alpha.
While Libmarpa is alpha
the major, minor and micro numbers must match exactly.

Once Libmarpa is beyond alpha releases,
compatibility will be defined by two things:
first the version
of the running library is newer than the version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}.
Second
the running library must be binary compatible with the
version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}
(same major version.)

Return value: @code{MARPA_ERR_NONE} if the Marpa library is compatible with the
requested version.  If the library is not compatible,
one of the following is returned, indicating the nature of the mismatch:
@itemize

An archtypal application has a grammar.
To create a grammar, use the @code{marpa_g_new()} method.
When a grammar is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
@code{marpa_g_unref()} method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more symbol.
To create symbols, use the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_new()} method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more rules.
To create rules, use the
@code{marpa_g_rule_new()} and
@code{marpa_g_sequence_new()} methods.

For non-trivial parsing,
one or more of the symbols must be terminals.
To mark a symbols a terminal,
use the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()} method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have exactly one start symbol.
To mark a symbol as the start symbol,
use the
@code{marpa_g_start_symbol_set()} method.

Before parsing with a grammar, it must be precomputed.
To precompute a grammar,
use the

    Marpa_Rule_ID @var{rule_id})
A rule is a loop rule if it non-trivially
produces the string of length one
which consists only of its LHS symbol.
``Non-trivially'' means the zero-step derivation does not count -- the
derivation must have at least one step.

The presence of a loop rule makes a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and applications will typically want to treat them as fatal errors.
But nothing forces an application to do this,
and Marpa will successfully parse and evaluate grammars with
loop rules.

Return value: On success, 1 if this is a loop rule, 0 if not.  If the grammar
is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{rhs_id}, @
     Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{separator_id}, @
    int @var{min}, @
 int @var{flags} )
Adds a new sequence rule to grammar @var{g}.
Internally, Libmarpa translates sequences into BNF
rules, but it also optimizes their evaluation.
In practice this speedup can be considerable.

The sequence is @var{lhs_id},
and the item to be repeated in the sequence is @var{rhs_id}.
The sequence must be repeated at least @var{min} times,
where @var{min} is 0 or 1.
If @var{separator_id} is non-negative,
it is a separator symbol.

If @code{flags & MARPA_PROPER_SEPARATION} is non-zero,
separation is ``proper'', that is,
a trailing separator is not allowed.
The term @dfn{proper} is based on the idea that
properly-speaking, separators should actually separate items.

The sequence RHS, or item,
is restricted to a single symbol,
but almost
any language and any semantics
can be expressed indirectly,
by using @var{rhs_id} be the LHS of another rule.
@var{rhs_id} cannot be a nullable symbol.
If @var{separator_id} is a symbol, it also cannot
be a nullable symbol.

Nullables on the RHS of sequences are restricted
because they lead to highly ambiguous grammars.
Such grammars are allowed by Libmarpa, but
they must be expressed using BNF rules, not sequence rules.
This is for two reasons:
First, sequence optimizations would not work
in the presence of nullables.
Second, since it is not completely clear what
an application intends
when it asks for a sequence of identical items,
some of which are nullable,
the user's intent can be more clearly expressed
directly in BNF.

Return value:  On success, the ID of the external rule.
If the rule duplicates another rule,
or on other failure, -2.

The separator symbol of a sequence rule is also considered
to be a counted symbol.

@node Grammar precomputation, Grammar events, Sequences, Grammar methods
@section Precomputing the Grammar

@deftypefun int marpa_g_precompute (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})
This function precomputes the grammar.

In the process, precomputation creates events which
the user can access.
On success, this function returns the number of events
generated,
but it is important to note that events may be
created whether precomputation fails or succeeds.
When the method fails,
the application must call @code{marpa_g_event()}
if it wants to determine if any events occurred.
Since the reason for failure to precompute is often
detailed in the events, failed applications will often
be at least as interested in the events as those
which succeeded.

A @code{MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES} event occurs
when there are infinite loop rules (cycles)
in the grammar.
Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous.
They are considered useless in current
practice,
and make processing the grammar less
efficient, sometimes considerably so.
Most applications will want to treat them
as errors.
Nonetheless, they are not errors in Libmarpa,
and do not prevent Libmarpa from parsing.

Each @code{MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE} event is a symbol
which is a nullable on the right hand side of a sequence
rule -- a ``counted'' symbol.
The presence of one or more of these is a hard failure.
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
these failures are delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

Each @code{MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL} event is a nulling
symbol which is also flagged as a terminal.
Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical
impossibility, and
the presence of one or more of these is a hard failure.
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
the failure is delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

Precomputation involves freezing
and then thoroughly checking the grammar,
and it is at this point that many failures
are caught and reported.
Counted nullables and nulling terminals have
already been mentioned.
Grammars without rules and those
with invalid start symbols also produce
hard failures.

Return value: On success, the number of events generated.
If the grammar is already precomputed,
or on other failure, -2.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_g_is_precomputed (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})

@deftypefun int marpa_g_has_cycle (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})
This function allows the application to determine if grammar
@var{g} has a cycle.
As mentioned, most applications will want to treat these
as fatal errors.
To determine which rules are in the cycle,
@var{marpa_g_rule_is_loop()} can be used.

Return value: On success, 1 if the grammar has a cycle,
0 otherwise.
On failure, -2.

@section Overview

An archtypal application uses a recognizer to read input.
To create a recognizer, use the @code{marpa_r_new()} method.
When a recognizer is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
@code{marpa_r_unref()} method.

In order to allow future extensions that change settings
before the recognizer is set up for input,
when the recognizer is created,
it is @strong{not} created ready for input.
To make a recognizer ready for input,
Use the @code{marpa_r_start_input()} method.

The recognizer starts with its current earleme
at location 0.
To read a token at the current earleme,
use the @code{marpa_r_alternative()} call.

To complete the processing of the current earleme,
and move forward to a new one,
use the @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void marpa_r_unref (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})
Decreases the reference count by 1,

When @var{r} is destroyed, the reference count
of its base grammar is decreased by one.
It this takes the reference count of the base grammar

@deftypefun int marpa_r_start_input (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})
Makes @var{r} ready to accept input.

Return value:  On success, a non-negative value.
On failure, -2.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int marpa_r_alternative (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r}, @
    Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{token_id}, @
    int @var{value}, @
    int @var{length})
Reads a token into @var{r}.
The token will start at the current earleme.
Libmarpa allows tokens to be ambiguous, to be of
variable length and to overlap.
@var{token_id} is the symbol of the token,
which must be a terminal.
@var{length} is the length of the token.

@var{value} is an
integer which represents the value of the
token.
In applications where the token's value is not an integer, it is
expected that the application will use this value to
find the application's value, perhaps by using @var{value}
to index an array.
@var{value} is not used inside Libmarpa -- it is simply
stored to be returned by the valuator
as a convenience for the application.
Some applications will not want to use Libmarpa's token
values, instead tracking their own, perhaps based on
the earleme location, and @var{token_id}.

A @var{value} of 0 has special significance -- it indicates
that the token is unvalued -- that its value is allowed
to be unpredictable.
Note that if a token is unvalued,
it must be the case,
not just that Libmarpa need not care about its value,
but also that @strong{the application}
does not care about the value of the token.
When a token has a ``whatever'' value, Libmarpa 
optimizes away the valuator steps which
give the application an opportunity to provide
a value for that token.
Applications which do not use Libmarpa's token values,
but which @strong{do} care about the token's value,
must tell Libmarpa not to optimize away the
relevant valuator steps.
An application can do this by
letting @var{value} be any non-zero integer.

If, on the first read by
@code{marpa_r_alternative()},
symbol @var{token_id} is not already locked,
the valued status
of symbol @var{token_id}
will be set according to its
use in that call
to @code{marpa_r_alternative()},
and symbol @var{token_id}
will be locked in that valued status.
Once symbol
@var{token_id} is locked in valued status,
it must be used as a valued symbol.
Similarly, once symbol
@var{token_id} is locked in unvalued status,
it must be used as a unvalued symbol.

When @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
is successful,
the value of furthest earleme is set to
the greater of its value before the call,
and @var{current}+@var{length},
where @var{current} is the value of the current earleme.
The values of the current and latest earlemes
are unchanged by
calls to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}.

Return value:  On success, returns a non-negative value.
If the token was not accepted because @var{token_id} is unexpected,
it is considered a soft failure,
and @code{marpa_r_alternative()} returns -1.
If the token was not accepted because it
is a duplicate,
it is considered a soft failure,
and @code{marpa_r_alternative()} returns -3.
Other problems that prevent successful processing,
are considered hard failures,
and -2 is returned.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun Marpa_Earleme marpa_r_earleme_complete (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})
This method does the final processing for the current earleme.
It then advances the current earleme by one.
Note that @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} may be called
even when no tokens have been read at the current earleme --
in the character-per-earleme input model, for example, tokens
can span many characters and, if the input is unambiguous over that
span, there will be no other tokens that start inside it.

As mentioned,
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} always advances the current earleme,
incrementing its value by 1.
This means that value of the current earleme after the call
will be the one plus the value of the earleme processed by the call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
If any token was accepted at the earleme being processed,
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} creates a new Earley set
which will be the latest Earley set,
and, after the call, the latest
earleme will be equal to the new current earleme.
If no token was accepted at the
earleme being processed,
no Earley set is created,
and the value of the latest earleme remains unchanged.
The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
a call to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.

During this method, one or more events may occur.
On success, this function returns the number of events
generated,
but it is important to note that events may be
created whether earleme completion fails or succeeds.
When this method fails,
the application must call @code{marpa_r_event()}
if it wants to determine if any events occurred.
Since the reason for failure to complete an earleme is often
detailed in the events, applications that fail will often
be at least as interested in the events as those
that succeed.

@code{MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED} indicates that the parse is
exhausted -- that no input will be accepted at later earlemes.
Note that an exhausted parse can be a successful one -- it
just cannot succeed at a later earleme than the current one.

The @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} event
indicates that an application-settable threshold
on the number of Earley items has been reached or exceeded.
What this means depends on the application,
but when the default threshold is exceeded,
it means that it is very likely
that the time and space resources consumed by
the parse will prove excessive.

Return value:  On success, the number of events generated.
On failure, -2.

    Marpa_Earley_Set_ID @var{set_id})

In the default, token-stream model, Earley set ID and earleme
are always equal, but this is not the case in other input
models.

At this writing, there is no method for
the inverse operation (conversion of an earleme to an Earley set
ID).
One consideration in writing
such a method is that not all earlemes correspond to Earley sets.
Applications using the standard input model
can take advantage of the exact equivalence of Earley set
ID's and earlemes in that model.
Other applications may need to create an ID-to-earleme
array using the @code{marpa_r_earleme()} method,
and invert it themselves.

Return value:

As a byproduct of recognition,
the recognizer has tables.
Before parsing, an archtypal application must create
a bocage.
A bocage is structure containing all the parses found
for the input.

Because Libmarpa parses ambiguous grammars, the bocage may
contain many parses.
(For those familiar with them, a bocage is
a specialized and extended parse forest.)

To create a bocage, use the @code{marpa_b_new()} method.
When a recognizer is no longer in use, its memory can be freed

Once the bocage has an ordering, the parses trees can be iterated.
Marpa's @dfn{parse tree iterators} iterate the parse trees contained
in a bocage object.
In Libmarpa,
``parse tree iterators'' are usually just called @dfn{trees}.

To create a tree, use the @code{marpa_t_new()} method.
When a tree is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
@code{marpa_t_unref()} method.

To position a new tree iterator to the first parse tree,
use the @code{marpa_t_next()} method.
To step through subsequent parse trees,
use the @code{marpa_t_next()} method.

@node Value overview, How to use the valuator, Value methods, Value methods
@section Overview

The archetypal application needs
a value object (or @dfn{valuator}) to produce
the value of the parse.
To create a valuator, use the @code{marpa_v_new()} method.
When a valuator is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
@code{marpa_v_unref()} method.

By default, Libmarpa assumes that
non-terminal symbols have
no semantics.
The archetypal application will need to register
symbols that contain semantics.
The primary method for doing this is
@code{marpa_v_symbol_is_valued()}.
Applications registering semantics may find
it convenient to do so directly using
the @code{marpa_v_rule_is_valued()} method,
which will save them the trouble
of looking up the rule's LHS symbol.

The application is required to maintain the stack,
and the application is also required to implement
most of the semantics, including the evaluation
of rules.
Libmarpa's valuator provides instructions to
the application on how to manipulate the stack.
To iterate through this series of instructions,
use the @code{marpa_v_step()} method.

@code{marpa_v_step()} returns the type
of step.
Most step types has values associated with them.
To access these values use the methods
described in @ref{Step accessors}.
How to perform the steps is described in
@ref{How to use the valuator}
and @ref{Stepping through the valuator}.

@node How to use the valuator, Advantages of Libmarpa's valuator, Value overview, Value methods
@section How to use the valuator
Libmarpa's valuator provides the application with
``steps'', which are
instructions for stack manipulation.
Libmarpa itself does not maintain a stack.
This leaves the upper layer in total control of the
stack and the values which are placed on it.

As example may make this clearer.
Suppose the evalution is at a place in the parse tree
where an addition is being performed.
Libmarpa does not know that the operation
is an addition.
It will tell the application that rule number @math{R}
is to be applied to the arguments at stack locations
@math{N} and @math{N+1}, and that the result is to placed in
stack location @math{N}.

In this system
the application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule @math{R} and determines that it
is an addition.
The application can do this by using @math{R} as an index
into an array of callbacks, or by any other method
it chooses.
Let's assume a callback implements the semantics
for rule @math{R}.
Libmarpa has told the application that two arguments
are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations @math{N} and @math{N+1} in the stack.
They might be the numbers 42 and 711.
So the callback is called with its two arguments,
and produces a return value, let's say, 753.
Libmarpa has told the application that the result
belongs at location @math{N} in the stack,
so the application writes 753 to location @math{N}.

Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics,
the operation for rule R could be string concatenation
instead of addition.
Or, if it is addition, it could allow for its arguments
to be floating point or complex numbers.
Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers,
strings, complex numbers, or polymorphic objects which are
capable of being any of these things and more.

@node Advantages of Libmarpa's valuator, Details of stack manipulation, How to use the valuator, Value methods
@section Advantages of Libmarpa's valuator

This technique
hides Libmarpa's grammar rewrites from the application,
and is actually quite efficient.
Libmarpa knows which rules are sequences
and optimizes stack manipulations based on this knowledge.
Many practical grammars use long sequences heavily
and, for these,
the series of steps
suggest by Libmarpa will be significantly faster than the standard
stack evaluation algorithm in the textbooks.

To make it clear,
we are under no illusion
that direct use of Libmarpa's valuator will be found
satisfactory by most application programmers,
even in the C language.
The author certainly avoids using it directly.
Libmarpa's valuator is intended
to be used via an upper layer,
one which @strong{does} know about semantics.

To see the advantage
of isolating Libmarpa from semantics,
suppose
that Libmarpa is used as the basis
for a higher-level language which needs callbacks in that higher level language.
For generality, Libmarpa would have to deal in C callbacks,
and a middle layer would have to create C language wrappers
for the callbacks in the higher level language.
This intermixture of languages is very hard to handle,
especially when debugging.
Programmers typically react to these difficulties by
doing the minimum possible in the callbacks themselves,
and as much as possible in pre- and post-processing.
But this division of the work is usually undesirable
from other points of view,
sometimes highly so.
But the ability to debug can make the difference between
code that does work and code that does not,
and that consideration will typically trump others.

Libmarpa valuator's method of handling semantics
does well in terms of those other considerations.
Step-driven valuation may seem complex and indirect
at first, but the programmer will find that the
pushing the semantics up to a layer which knows more
about it simplifies many things.
Step-driven valuation also makes it unnecessary
to divide the logic 
between pre-processing, main processing,
and post-processing, unless the semantics
themselves suggest such an approach.
Finally, step-driven valuation
is usually slightly more efficient
when the callbacks are in C,
and is almost always significantly more efficient
when the callbacks would have to be
to a higher-level language.

@node Details of stack manipulation, Valuator constructor, Advantages of Libmarpa's valuator, Value methods
@section Details of stack manipulation

In manipulating the stack, if the application
is mantaining a conventional physical stack,
it is up
the application to ensure that all locations
that it writes to or reads from actually
exist.
In the form we have stated it,
this requirement sounds obvious,
However, the existence of unvalued symbols,
and the optimization of stack manipulations
involving them,
offers some room for surprise.
This section discusses the requirements for
safe stack manipulation in detail.

* Implications for literal stack manipulation::  
* Implications for non-literal implementations::  
@end menu

@node Implications for literal stack manipulation, Implications for non-literal implementations, Details of stack manipulation, Details of stack manipulation
@subsection Implications for literal stack manipulation

In this section,
we assume that
the application is keeping a physical stack,
and that the application is following the valuator's stack
manipulation instructions strictly and literally.
That is, when the application is told a rule's
arguments are in the locations from X to Y,
it reads locations from X to Y of a physical stack.
And when the application is told that the result
goes into stack location Z,
the application writes to location Z of a physical stack.
Many, if not most,
applications will implement their semantics
in exactly this way.

The application needs to be aware that the
valuator may ask it to read from an stack location
N, even though it was never instructed to write
to location N.
This will not be an issue if the stack is implemented as,
say, a Perl array, because Perl extends and initializes
arrays as necessary, on both read and write.
From the point of view of the programmer of a language
like Perl, therefore, the discussion
of this section will be a non-issue.

The situation for the C programmer is more complicated,
to put it mildly.
We assume the C programmer is using a dynamic array as
a stack.
Under these circumstances, a read from an never-written
location beyond the end of the array,
may cause a memory fault.
In fact, if the C programmer is following the standards,
she has to allow for ``trap values''.
That is, she must assume that uninitialized locations,
even within the
array bounds, may contain values which will cause an
abend on read.

The C programmer implementing Libmarpa semantics literally
and using a dynamic array as a stack, must ensure that
the stack is extended
@strong{and initialized to non-trap values}
before each write
and @strong{before each read}.
When implementing a rule's semantics,
it is sufficient to ensure that the rule's arguments
exist and are initialized on the stack.
The programmer is allowed to assume that stack location
for a rule's result will be at or before
the stack location of the rule's last argument.

This ``read with no previous write'' behavior occurs
because of unvalued symbols.
If a symbol is unvalued, the write to it may be
optimized away, but often the read from that location
may not be.
If the application has registered its valued symbols
properly, 
it will be indifferent to whatever value is
in the stack at the location
for the unvalued symbol.

@node Implications for non-literal implementations,  , Implications for literal stack manipulation, Details of stack manipulation
@subsection Implications for non-literal implementations

It is tempting to think there may be ways to
avoid reading never-written values
when using less-than-literal implementations.
The programmer needs to be aware that reads
beyond the end of stack are only part of the problem.
Specifically,
@itemize
@item Many of the locations of never-written values
will be within the stack.
@item Many of within-the-stack locations never written for a particular
value may have been used
for other values, and therefore will still have one
of those previous values.
@item Other never-written within-the-stack locations will never have
been written to for any value,
and therefore must be assumed by standard-conformant C code
potentially to contain trap values.

Stack location @var{X} is said to be ``greater''

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE
A "counted" symbol was found,
that is also a nullable symbol.
A "counted" symbol is one that appears on the RHS
of a sequence rule.
If a symbol is nullable,
counting occurrences of it,
which is what sequence rules do for their RHS
symbols,
becomes very difficult.
Questions of definition and
problems of implementation arise.
At a minimum, such a sequence would be wildly
ambigious.

Sequence rules are simply an optimized shorthand
for rules that can also be written in ordinary BNF.
If the equivalent of a sequence of nullables is
really what your application needs,
nothing in Libmarpa prevents you from specifying
that sequence
with ordinary BNF rules.

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_DEVELOPMENT
Internal.
"Development" errors were used heavily during
Libmarpa's development,
when it is not yet clear how precisely
to classify every error condition.
Users of the external interface in released
non-developer's versions should never
see development errors.

Development errors has an error string
associated with them.
The error string is a
short 7-bit ASCII error string
which describes the error.

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_RULE
This error indicates an attempt to add a rule which
is a duplicate of a rule already in the grammar.
Two rules are considered duplicates if

@itemize @bullet
@item
Both rules have the same left hand symbol.
@item
Both rules have the same right hand symbols in the same order.
@end itemize

This definition applies to sequence rules, as well as to ordinary rules. As a consequence, sequence rules can be considered duplicates even when they have different separators and/or different minimum counts.
Suggested message: "Duplicate rule"

@deftypevr Macro int MARPA_ERR_EIM_COUNT
Libmarpa allows a maximum number of earley
items per Earley set.
This error code indicates that limit was
exceeded.
Note that this limit is different from
the optional earley item
warning threshold, which can be set
by the application.
Exceeding the warning threshold causes
a Libmarpa event, which the application
is free to treat as a hard or soft error.
Suggested message: "Maximum number of earley items exceeded"

Most likely, memory will run out for
other reasons long before this error can
occur.
The maximum earley item count for the
purposes of this error code
is over a billion.
As a contrast, a reasonable setting for the
warning threshold,
even when exceeding the threshold is
treated as a fatal error,
will usually be well under 1000.
If this error code ever does occur,
it is almost certainly both a hard and a
fatal error.

The location (Earley set ID) is not valid.
It may be invalid because it is negative,

a negative Earley set ID has a special meaning.
It may be invalid because it is after the latest Earley set.

For users of input models other than the standard one,
the term ``location'', as used in association

means Earley set ID or Earley set ordinal.
In the standard input model, this will always

An internal error code may be one of two things:
First,
it can be an error code which
arises from an internal Libmarpa programming issue
(in other words, something happening in the code
that was not supposed to be able to happen.)
Second, it can be an error code which only occurs
when a method from Libmarpa's internal interface
is used.
Both kinds of internal error message share one common
trait -- users of the Libmarpa's external interface
should never see them.

Internal error messages
require someone with knowledge of the Libmarpa internals
to follow up on them.

@section Why so many time objects?

Readers accustomed to other appraoches to parsing,
particular those in fashion at this writing,
may wonder on the number of time objects
in the Marpa architecture.
Several of Marpa's time objects (bocages,
orderings and trees) are required
because Marpa allows,
and offers powerful tools for dealing with,
ambigious grammars.

It may seem, then, that users of unambiguous grammars,
are paying a considerable price in time effiency
for the ability to parse
ambiguous ones.
This is not the case.
In the trivial case, the cost of the orderings
object is a single, very brief, subroutine call.

Bocage objects come at minimal cost,
because the same pass which creates the bocage
also deals with other issues which are of major
significance even for unambiguous parses.
The same pass which creates the bocage
enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.

Tree objects come at mininal cost to unambiguous grammars,
because the same pass that allows iteration through multiple
parse trees does the tree traversal, so that the valuation time object
has very litle to do -- it just steps through the sequence.

But what about the many passes over the data this requires?
Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.
Marpa achieves its efficiency,
not in spite of making multiple
passes over the data, but because of it.
Marpa is @math{O(n)} for LR-regular grammars,
both in theory and in implementation,
because Marpa regularly substitutes
two fast @math{O(n)} passes for a single
@math{O(n log n)} pass.

@menu
* Why ordering objects?::       
@end menu

@node Why ordering objects?,  , Why so many time objects, Why so many time objects
@subsection Why ordering objects?

Of the various objects, the best
case for elimination is of the
ordering object.
In many cases, the ordering is trivial.
Either the parse is unambiguous, or the
application does not care about the order in
which parses are returned.

But while it would be easy to add an option
to bypass creation of an ordering object,
there is little to be gained from it.
When the ordering is trivial,
its overhead is very small --
essentially a handful of subroutine calls.
Many orderings accomplish nothing,
but these cost next to nothing.

@node Design of numbered objects,  , Why so many time objects, Design considerations
@section Numbered objects

As the name suggests,
the choice was made to implement
numbered objects and not as
pointers.
Integers can be easily and safely checked for validity,
while pointer cannot.

There are efficiency tradeoffs between pointers and
integers but they are complications and go both ways.
Pointers can be faster, but integers can be used
as indexes into more than one data structure.
Which is actually faster depends on the design.
Integers allow for a more flexible design,
so that once the choice is settled on,
careful programming can make them a win,
possibly a very big one.

The approach taken in Libmarpa was to settle
from the outset,
on integers as the implementation for numbered
objects and optimize on that basis.
In any case, the difference is speed on
modern architectures is
a small price to pay for
safe, portable validity checking.

Reports and sets, respectively, the ``use Leo'' flag.
This flag controls whether Joop Leo's method for fast parsing
of right recursion is used.
By default, this value is 1 and Leo parsing is in use.
This default should be used except for testing, debugging
and development.

Returns the data for the token of the and-node.
The symbol id is the return value,
and the token value is placed
in the location pointed
to by @var{value_p}, if that is non-null.
If @var{and_node_id} is not the ID of an and-node
whose cause is a token,
returns -1,
without changing @var{value_p}.
On hard failure, returns -2 without changing
@var{value_p}.

There is no function to simply return the token value --
because of the need to indicate errors, it is just as
easy to return the symbol ID as well.

@section Tree internals

In Marpa, a nook is any node of a parse tree.
The usual term is "node",
but within Marpa,
the word "node" is already heavily overloaded.
So what most texts call "tree nodes" are here
called "nooks".
"Nook" can be thought of as a pun on both
"node" and "fork".

@deftypefun int _marpa_t_size ( @
	Marpa_Tree @var{t})
Return the size of the parse tree.
This is the number of nooks in its stack.
If there is a serious error,
or if the tree is uninitialized, return -2.
If the tree is exhausted, return -1.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun Marpa_Or_Node_ID _marpa_t_nook_or_node ( @
    Marpa_Tree @var{t}, @

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int _marpa_t_nook_choice ( @
	Marpa_Tree @var{t}, @
	Marpa_Nook_ID @var{nook_id} @
	)

Return the current choice for @var{nook_id}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int _marpa_t_nook_parent ( @
	Marpa_Tree @var{t}, @
	Marpa_Nook_ID @var{nook_id} @
	)

Return the parent nook's ID for @var{nook_id}.
As with the other nook trace functions,
-1 is returned if @var{nook_id} is not the ID of
a nook on the stack,
but -1 can also be a valid value.
If that's an issue, the @var{nook_id} needs
to be checked with one of the trace functions
where -1 is never a valid value ---
for example, @code{_marpa_t_nook_or_node}.

@deftypefun int _marpa_t_nook_cause_is_ready ( @
