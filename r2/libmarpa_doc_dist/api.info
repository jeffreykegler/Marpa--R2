GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*********************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version
     3 of the GNU General Public License.

     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
     other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface
     provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
     Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
     deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
     Application with the Library.  The particular version of the
     Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
     "Linked Version".

     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
     Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
     code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
     isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked
     Version.

     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
     object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
     data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
     from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
     Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
     License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
     facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
     Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument
     passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy
     of the modified version:

       a. under this License, provided that you make a good faith
          effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
          supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

       b. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
          this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
     from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey
     such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
     incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
     and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
     following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

       b. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
          license document.

  4. Combined Works.

     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
     taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
     portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each
     of the following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

       b. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and
          this license document.

       c. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
          these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
          the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

       d. Do one of the following:

            0. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
               of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
               in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the
               user to recombine or relink the Application with a
               modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
               modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by
               section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
               Source.

            1. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
               the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses
               at run time a copy of the Library already present on the
               user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
               with a modified version of the Library that is
               interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

       e. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
          otherwise be required to provide such information under
          section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
          information is necessary to install and execute a modified
          version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
          relinking the Application with a modified version of the
          Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source
          and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
          you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
          specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side by side in a single library together with other
     library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
     by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
     your choice, if you do both of the following:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
          it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
          find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to
     time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
     Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
     version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later
     version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
     and conditions either of that published version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
     as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the
     GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
     Software Foundation.

     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
     whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
     shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any
     version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version
     for the Library.

1.1 How to read this document
=============================

This is essentially a reference document, but its early chapters lay
out concepts essential to the others.  Readers will usually want to
read the chapters up and including *note Introduction to the external
interface:: in order.  Otherwise, they should follow their interests.

1.2 Prerequisites
=================

This document is very far from self-contained.  It assumes the
following:
   * The reader knows the C programming language at least well enough
     to understand function prototypes and return values.

   * The reader has read the documents for one of Libmarpa's upper
     layers.  As of this writing, the only such layer is `Marpa::R2',
     in Perl.

   * The reader knows some parsing theory.  *Note Parsing theory::.

1.3 Parsing theory
==================

This document assumes some acquaintance with parsing theory.  The
reader's level of knowledge is probably adequate if he can answer the
following questions, either immediately or after a little reflection.
   * What is a BNF rule?

   * What is a Marpa sequence rule?

   * As a reminder, Marpa's sequence rules are implemented as left
     recursions.  What does that mean?

   * Take a Marpa sequence rule at random.  What does it look like when
     rewritten in BNF?

   * What does the sequence look like when rewritten in BNF as a
     right-recursion?

2 About Libmarpa
****************

Libmarpa implements the Marpa parsing algorithm.  Marpa is named after
the legendary 11th century Tibetan translator, Marpa Lotsawa.  In
creating Marpa, I depended heavily on previous work by Jay Earley, Joop
Leo, John Aycock and Nigel Horspool.

   Libmarpa implements the entire Marpa algorithm.  This library does
the necessary grammar preprocessing, recognizes the input, and produces
parse trees.  It also supports the ordering, iteration and evaluation
of the parse trees.

   Libmarpa is very low-level.  For example, it has no strings.  Rules,
symbols, and token values are all represented by integers.  This, of
course, will not suffice for many applications.  Users will very often
want names for the symbols, non-integer values for tokens, or both.
Typically, applications will use arrays to translate Libmarpa's integer
ID's to strings or other values as required.

   Libmarpa also does *not* implement most of the semantics.  Libmarpa
does have an evaluator (called a "valuator"), but it does *not*
manipulate the stack directly.  Instead, Libmarpa, based on its
traversal of the parse tree, passes optimized step by step stack
manipulation instructions to the upper layer.  These instructions
indicate the token or rule involved, and the proper location for the
true token value or the result of the rule evaluation.  For rule
evaluations, the instructions include the stack location of the
arguments.

   Marpa requires most semantics to be implemented in the application.
This allows the application total flexibility.  It also puts the
application is in a much better position to prevent errors, to catch
errors at runtime or, failing all else, to successfully debug the logic.

File: api.info,  Node: Major objects,  Next: Time objects,  Prev: Architecture,  Up: Architecture

3.1 Major objects
=================

The classes of Libmarpa's object system fall into two types: major and
numbered.  These are the Libmarpa's major classes, in sequence.

   * Configuration: A configuration object is a thread-safe way to hold
     configuration variables, as well as the return code from failed
     attempts to create grammar objects.

   * Grammar: A grammar object contains rules and symbols, with their
     properties.

   * Recognizer: A recognizer object reads input.

   * Bocage: A bocage object is a collection of parse trees, as found
     by a recognizer.  Bocages are similar to parse forests.

   * Ordering: An ordering object is an ordering of the trees in a
     bocage.

   * Tree: A tree object is a bocage iterator.

   * Value: A value object is a tree iterator.  Iteration of tree using
     a value object produces "steps".  These "steps" are instructions to
     the application on how to evaluate the semantics, and how to
     manipulate the stack.

   The major objects have one letter abbreviations, which are used
frequently.  These are, in the standard sequence,

   * Configuration:  C

   * Grammar:  G

   * Recognizer: R

   * Bocage: B

   * Ordering: O

   * Tree: T

   * Value: V


File: api.info,  Node: Time objects,  Next: Reference counting,  Prev: Major objects,  Up: Architecture

3.2 Time objects
================

All of Libmarpa's major classes, except the configuration class, are
"time" classes.  Except for objects in the grammar class, all time
objects are created from another time object.  Each time object is
created from a time object of the class before it in the sequence.  A
recognizer cannot be created without a precomputed grammar; a bocage
cannot be created without a recognizer; and so on.

   When one time object is used to create a second time object, the
first time object is the "parent object" and the second time object is
the "child object".  For example, when a bocage is created from a
recognizer, the recognizer is the parent object, and the bocage is the
child object.

   Grammars have no parent object.  Every other time object has exactly
one parent object.  Value objects have no child objects.  All other
time objects can have any number of children, from zero up to a number
determined by memory or some other machine-determined limit.

   Every time object has a "base grammar".  A grammar object is its own
base grammar.  The base grammar of a recognizer is the grammar that it
was created with.  The base grammar of any other time object is the base
grammar of its parent object.  For example, the base grammar of a
bocage is the base grammar of the recognizer that it was created with.


File: api.info,  Node: Reference counting,  Next: Numbered objects,  Prev: Time objects,  Up: Architecture

3.3 Reference counting
======================

Every object in a "time" class has its own, distinct, lifetime, which
is controlled by the object's reference count.  Reference counting
follows the usual practice.  Contexts which take a share of the
"ownership" of an object increase the reference count by 1.  When a
context relinquishes its share of the ownership of an object, it
decreases the reference count by 1.

   Each class of time object has a "ref" and an "unref" method, to be
used by those contexts which need to explicitly increment and decrement
the reference count.  For example, the "ref" method for the grammar
class is `marpa_g_ref()' and the "unref" method for the grammar class is
`marpa_g_unref()'.

   Time objects do not have explicit destructors.  When the reference
count of a time object reaches 0, that time object is destroyed.

   Much of the necessary reference counting is performed automatically.
The context calling the constructor of a time object does not need to
explicitly increase the reference count, because Libmarpa time objects
are always created with a reference count of 1.

   Child objects "own" their parents, and when a child object is
successfully created, the reference count of its parent object is
automatically incremented to reflect this.  When a child object is
destroyed, it automatically decrements the reference count of its
parent.

   In a typical application, a calling context needs only to remember
to "unref" each time object that it creates, once it is finished with
that time object.  All other reference decrements and increments are
taken care of automatically.  The typical application never needs to
explicitly call one of the "ref" methods.

   More complex applications may find it convenient to have one or more
contexts share ownership of objects created in another context.  These
more complex situations are the only cases in which the "ref" methods
will be needed.


File: api.info,  Node: Numbered objects,  Prev: Reference counting,  Up: Architecture

3.4 Numbered objects
====================

In addition to its major, "time" objects, Libmarpa also has numbered
objects.  Numbered objects do not have lifetimes of their own.  Every
numbered object belongs to a time object, and is destroyed with it.
Rules and symbols are numbered objects.  Tokens values are another
class of numbered objects.

File: api.info,  Node: The traditional model,  Next: The earleme variables,  Prev: Earlemes,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.1 The traditional model
---------------------------

In traditional Earley parsers, the concept of location is very simple.
Locations are numbered from 0 to N, where N is the length of the input.
Every location has an Earley set, and vice versa.  Location 0 is the
start location.  Every location after the start location has exactly
one input token associated with it.

   Some applications do not fit this traditional input model -- natural
language processing requires ambiguous tokens, for example.  Libmarpa
allows a wide variety of alternative input models.

   This document assumes that the reader knows the concepts behind
Libmarpa's alternative input models, either from the documentation of a
higher level interface, such as `Marpa::XS' or `Marpa::R2', or from
Marpa's theory document
(https://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa-theory/recce.pdf).

   As a reminder, in Libmarpa a location is called a "earleme".  The
number of an Earley set is the "ID of the Earley set", or its "ordinal".
In the traditional model, the ordinal of an Earley set and its earleme
are always exactly the same, but in Libmarpa they will be different.


File: api.info,  Node: The earleme variables,  Next: The significances of the earleme variables,  Prev: The traditional model,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.2 The earleme variables
---------------------------

The important earleme variables are the current earleme, the furthest
earleme and the latest earleme.  The "current earleme" is the earleme
that Libmarpa is currently working on.  More specifically, it is the
one at which new tokens will *start*.  Since tokens are never zero
length, a new token will always end after the current earleme.  The
current earleme is initially earleme 0.  Every call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' advances the current earleme by 1.

   The "furthest earleme" is the highest numbered (and therefore
"furthest") earleme at which a token ends.  The furthest earleme is
initially earleme 0.  With every call to `marpa_r_alternative()', the
end of the token it adds is calculated.  A token ends at the earleme
location CURRENT+LENGTH, where CURRENT is the current earleme, and
LENGTH is the length of the newly added token.  After a call to
`marpa_r_alternative()', the furthest earleme is its value before the
call, or CURRENT+LENGTH, whichever is greater.

   The "latest earleme" is the earleme of the latest Earley set.  The
"latest Earley set" is the last Earley set completed.  This is always
the highest numbered Earley set.  If there is an Earley set at the
current earleme, it is the latest Earley set and the latest earleme is
equal to the current earleme.  There is never an Earley set after the
current earleme.

   After every call to the `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' method that
adds a token, the value of the latest earleme is same as the value of
the current earleme.  After every call to the
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' method that does *not* add a token, the
value of the lastest earleme is unchanged from its value before the
call.


File: api.info,  Node: The significances of the earleme variables,  Next: The initial earleme settings,  Prev: The earleme variables,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.3 The significances of the earleme variables
------------------------------------------------

The current earleme tracks the advance of the recognizer through the
input.  Input tokens always start at the current earleme.  An
application can advance past the current earleme, by calling
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()', which increments the current earleme by 1.
After initialization, `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' is the only way to
manipulate the value of the current earleme.

   The furthest earleme tracks how "far out" tokens can be found.  In
the standard input model, calling `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' after
each `marpa_r_alternative()' call is sufficient to process all inputs,
and the furthest earleme's value can be typically be ignored.  In
alternative input models, if tokens have lengths greater than 1, calling
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' once after the last token is read may not
be enough to ensure that all tokens have been processed.  To ensure
that all tokens have been processed, an application must advance the
current earleme by calling `marpa_r_earleme_complete()', until the
current earleme is equal to the furthest earleme.

   The lastest earleme is the earleme of the last Earley set.  The
latest earleme is different from the current earleme if and only if
there is no Earley set at the current earleme.  A different end of
parsing can be specified, but by default, parsing is of the input in
the range from earleme 0 to the latest earleme.


File: api.info,  Node: The initial earleme settings,  Next: The standard model of input,  Prev: The significances of the earleme variables,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.4 The initial earleme settings
----------------------------------

All input models have the same initial values.  Initially the current,
latest and furthest earleme are always earleme 0.

   Understanding the settings of current, latest and furthest earleme is
crucial to working with advanced input models, and for this reason the
next sections will go through the possibilities carefully.  The
presentation will start with the most traditional and restrictive
models.  It will proceed to less restrictive models.


File: api.info,  Node: The standard model of input,  Next: Ambiguous input,  Prev: The initial earleme settings,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.5 The standard model of input
---------------------------------

In the standard model of input, calls to `marpa_r_alternative()' and
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' are made in pairs.  There is, first,
exactly one call to `marpa_r_alternative()', and it is for a token with
length 1.  Following it must be a call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.
For an input of length N, there will be exactly N such paired calls.

   Suppose, in the standard model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_alternative()', the following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call was C.
   Because this is the standard model, this means that we also know that
   * The latest earleme before the call was C.

   * The furthest earleme before the call was C.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_alternative()', the
following will be true:
   * The current earleme will still be C.

   * The latest earleme will still be C.

   * The furthest earleme will be C+1.

   Suppose, in the standard model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call is C.
   Because this is the standard model, this means that we also know that
   * The latest earleme before the call was C.

   * The furthest earleme before the call was C+1.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the
current, latest and furthest earlemes will be the same.  Specifically,
the following will be true:
   * The current earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The latest earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The furthest earleme will remain at C+1.

4.1.6 Ambiguous input
---------------------

As a first loosening of the standard model, we no longer require calls
to `marpa_r_alternative()' to be paired with calls to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.  Instead, we allow a series of one or
more calls to `marpa_r_alternative()' before each call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.  We still require that there be at least
one call to `marpa_r_alternative()' before each call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()', and we still require that all tokens have
a length of 1.

   In the ambiguous input model, the behavior of the current, latest
and furthest earlemes are exactly as described for the standard model,
with one minor exception: Where the current earleme is C, and a call to
`marpa_r_alternative()' is not the first of a series, the value of the
furthest earleme before the call will be C+1.


File: api.info,  Node: Variable length tokens,  Next: The generalized model,  Prev: Ambiguous input,  Up: Earlemes

4.1.7 Variable length tokens
----------------------------

Our next loosening of the restrictions is to allow variable length
tokens.  That is, instead of requiring that all tokens be of length 1,
we allow tokens to be of length 1 or longer.  This does change the
behavior of the earleme variables.

   Suppose, in the variable length token model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_alternative()', the following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call was C.  In this model, this
     means that the latest earleme before the call is also C.

   * The furthest earleme before the call was OLD_F.

   * The length of the token is LENGTH.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_alternative()', the
following will be true:
   * The current and latest earlemes will still be C.  The current and
     latest earlemes are never changed by a call to
     `marpa_r_alternative()'.

   * The furthest earleme will be either OLD_F or  C+LENGTH, whichever
     was greater.

   Suppose, in the variable length token model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call is C.  In this model, this
     means that the latest earleme before the call is also C.

   * The furthest earleme before the call is OLD_F.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the
following will be true:
   * The current earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The latest earleme will also be C+1.

   * The furthest earleme will still be OLD_F.  The furthest earleme is
     never changed by a call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.

4.1.8 The generalized model
---------------------------

To fully generalize the input model, we now need to remove only one
restriction.  We now allow empty earlemes -- earlemes with no tokens
and no Earley set.  For the generalized input model, the effect on the
earleme variables of a call to `marpa_r_alternative()' is exactly the
same as it is for the variable length input model.  The effect on the
earleme variables of a call to to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' depends
on whether or not that call creates an empty earleme.  A call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' creates an empty earleme if and only if it
falls into one of these two cases:
   * There has been no call to `marpa_r_alternative()' since recognizer
     initialization.

   * There has been no call to `marpa_r_alternative()' since the
     previous call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.

   Suppose, in the generalized input model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' that creates an empty earleme, the
following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call is C.

   * The latest earleme before the call is OLD_L.

   * The furthest earleme before the call is OLD_F.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the
following will be true:
   * The current earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The latest earleme will remain at OLD_L.  This means that the
     latest earleme will be less than the current earleme.

   * The furthest earleme will remain at OLD_F.  The furthest earleme
     is never changed by a call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.

   Suppose, in the generalized input model that, for a call to
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()' that does not creates an empty earleme,
the following is true:
   * The current earleme before the call is C.

   * The latest earleme before the call is OLD_L.

   * The furthest earleme before the call is OLD_F.
   In that case, after the call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()', the
following will be true:
   * The current earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The latest earleme will be advanced to C+1.

   * The furthest earleme will remain at OLD_F.  The furthest earleme
     is never changed by a call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.

4.1.9 General rules for the earleme variables
---------------------------------------------

At this point, the most generalized input model has been introduced.
Here are some useful facts about the earleme variables that will always
be the case, no matter which of the input models is in use.

   * The current earleme is greater than or equal to the latest earleme.

   * The furthest earleme is greater than or equal to the latest
     earleme.

   * If the parser is not exhausted, the furthest earleme is always
     greater than or equal to the current earleme.

   * In an exhausted parser, the furthest earleme is always less than
     or equal to the current earleme.

   * If the furthest earleme is greater than the current earleme, the
     parser is not exhausted.

   * For the furthest earleme to be less than the current earleme, the
     parser must be exhausted.


File: api.info,  Node: Terminals,  Prev: Earlemes,  Up: Input

4.2 Terminals
=============

A terminal symbol is a symbol which may appear in the input.
Traditionally, all LHS symbols, as well as the start symbol, must be
non-terminals.  This is Marpa's behavior, by default.

   Marpa allows the user to eliminate the distinction between terminals
and non-terminals.  In this, it differs from traditional parsers.  A
Libmarpa can arrange for a a terminal to appear on the LHS of one or
more rules, or for a terminal to be the start symbol.  However, since
terminals can never be zero length, it is a logical contradiction for a
nulling symbol to also be a terminal and Marpa does not allow it.

   Token values are `int''s.  Libmarpa does nothing with token values
except accept them from the application and return them during parse
evaluation.

File: api.info,  Node: How Libmarpa semantics work,  Next: Valued and unvalued symbols,  Prev: Semantics,  Up: Semantics

5.1 How the Libmarpa semantics work
===================================

Libmarpa handling of semantics is unusual.  Most semantics are left up
to the application, but Libmarpa guides them.  Specifically, the
application is expected to maintain the evaluation stack.  Libmarpa's
valuator provides instructions on how to handle the stack.  Libmarpa's
stack handling instructions are called "steps".  For example, a
Libmarpa step might tell the application that the value of a token
needs to go into a certain stack position.  Or a Libmarpa step might
tell the application that a rule is to be evaluated.  For rule
evalution, Libmarpa will tell the application where the operands are to
be found, and where the result must go.

   The detailed discussion of Libmarpa's handling of semantics is in
the reference chapters of this document, under the appropriate methods
and classes.  The most extensive discussion of the semantics is in the
section that deals with the methods of the value time class.  *Note
Value methods::.


File: api.info,  Node: Valued and unvalued symbols,  Prev: How Libmarpa semantics work,  Up: Semantics

5.2 Valued and unvalued symbols
===============================

Libmarpa symbols can have values, which is the traditional way of doing
semantics.  Libmarpa also allows symbols to be unvalued.  An "unvalued"
symbol is one whose value is unpredictable from instance to instance.
If a symbol is unvalued, we sometimes say that it has "whatever"
semantics.

   Situations where the semantics can tolerate unvalued symbols are
surprisingly frequent.  For example, the top-level of many languages is
a series of major units, all of whose semantics are typically
accomplished via side effects.  The compiler is typically indifferent
to the actual value produced by these major units, and tracking them is
a waste of time.  Similarly, the value of the separators in a list is
typically ignored.

   Rules are unvalued if and only if their LHS symbols are unvalued.
When rules and symbols are unvalued, Libmarpa optimizes their
evaluation.

   It is in principle unsafe to check the value of a symbol if it can
be unvalued.  For this reason, once a symbol has been treated as valued,
Libmarpa marks it as valued.  Similarly, once a symbol has been treated
as unvalued, Libmarpa marks it as unvalued.  Once marked, a symbol's
valued status is "locked" and cannot be changed later.

   The valued status of terminals is marked the first time they are
read.  The valued status of LHS symbols must be explicitly marked by
the application when initializing the valuator -- this is Libmarpa's
equivalent of registering a callback.

   LHS terminals are disabled by default.  If allowed, the user should
be aware that the valued status of a LHS terminal will be locked in the
recognizer if it is used as a terminal, and the symbol's use as a rule
LHS in the valuator must be consistent with the recognizer's marking.

   Marpa reports an error when a symbol's use conflicts with its locked
valued status.  Doing so usually saves the programmer some tricky
debugging further down the road.  But it is possible that an
application might deliberately want to mix valued and unvalued uses of
a symbol -- an application might be able to differentiate them using
the larger context, or might be tolerant of the uncertainty.  If there
is interest, a future Libmarpa extension might allow a locked valued
status to be overriden.

6 Threads
*********

Libmarpa is thread-safe, given circumstances as described below.  The
Libmarpa methods are not reentrant.

   Libmarpa is C89-compliant.  It uses no global data, and calls only
the routines that are defined in the C89 standard and that can be made
thread-safe.  In most modern implementations, the default C89
implementation is thread-safe to the extent possible.  But the C89
standard does not require thread-safety, and even most modern
environments allow the user to turn thread safety off.  To be
thread-safe, Libmarpa must be compiled and linked in an environment
that provides thread-safety.

   While Libmarpa can be used safely across multiple threads, a
Libmarpa grammar cannot be.  Further, a Libmarpa time object can only
be used safely in the same thread as its base grammar.  This is because
all time objects with the same base grammar share data from that base
grammar.

   To work around this limitation, the same grammar definition can be
used to a create a new Libmarpa grammar time object in each thread.  If
there is sufficient interest, future versions of Libmarpa could allow
thread-safe cloning of grammars and other time objects.

7 Fatal Errors
**************

Libmarpa avoids fatal errors, leaving that decision up to the
application, with one exception.  Currently, if `malloc' fails to
allocate memory, Libmarpa terminates the program with a fatal error.

   While this is in keeping with current practice, future versions of
Libmarpa are likely to both allow an alternative memory allocator to be
specificied, and to allow the user to specifier a handler to be called
when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

File: api.info,  Node: About the overviews,  Next: Return values,  Prev: Introduction to the external interface,  Up: Introduction to the external interface

8.1 About the overviews
=======================

The reference sections for each major class begin with an overview.
These sections name the most important Libmarpa methods in the order in
which they are typically used, and very briefly describe their purpose.
The overviews are intended as "cheat sheets".

   The overview sections often speak of an "archetypal" application.
The archetypal Libmarpa application implements a complete logic flow,
starting with the creation of a grammar, and proceeding all the way to
the return of the final result from a value object.  In the archetypal
Libmarpa application, the grammar, input and semantics are all small
but non-trivial.


File: api.info,  Node: Return values,  Next: Naming conventions,  Prev: About the overviews,  Up: Introduction to the external interface

8.2 Return values
=================

Return values are discussed method by method, but some general
practices are worth mentioning.  For methods that return an integer,
Libmarpa usually reserves -1 for special purposes, such as indicating
loop termination in an iterator.  In Libmarpa, methods usually indicate
failure by returning -2.  Any result greater than -2 usually indicates
success.

   If a method returns an pointer value, `NULL' usually indicates
failure.  Any other result usually indicates success.

   On failure, a Libmarpa method always sets the error code.  On
success, a Libmarpa method may take one of three actions:
   * Set an informational error code.

   * Leave the error code as it is.

   * Reset the error code to `MARPA_ERROR_NONE'.

   Which of the three actions the method takes on success should be
regarded as unspecified, unless stated in the description of the method
in this document.  If a method sets an informational error code on
success, that will always be stated in its description, and the
description will specify, for each informational error code, the
specific error code value, the circumstances under which it is set, and
what return values will accompany it.

   Informational error codes are set because some applications may find
them convenient.  Typically information error codes are redundant
information, which may be ignored.

   A method can have many reasons for failing, and many of the reasons
for failure are common to large number of methods.  Full descriptions
of the error codes that are returned by the external methods are given
in their own section.  *Note External error codes::.


File: api.info,  Node: Naming conventions,  Prev: Return values,  Up: Introduction to the external interface

8.3 Naming conventions
======================

Methods in Libmarpa follow a strict naming convention.  All methods
have a name beginning with `marpa_', if they are part of the external
interface.  If an external method is not a static method, its name is
prefixed with one of `marpa_c_', `marpa_g_', `marpa_r_', `marpa_b_',
`marpa_o_', `marpa_t_' or `marpa_v_', where the single letter between
underscores is one of the Libmarpa major class abbreviations.  The
letter indicates which class the method belongs to.

   Methods that are exported, but that are part of the internal
interface, begin with `_marpa_'.  Methods that are part of the internal
interface (often called "internal methods") are subject to change and
are intended for use only by Libmarpa's developers.

   Libmarpa reserves the `marpa_' and `_marpa_' prefixes for itself,
with all their capitalization variants.  All Libmarpa names visible
outside the package will begin with a capitalization variant of one of
these two prefixes.

***************

 -- Function: Marpa_Error_Code marpa_check_version (unsigned int
          REQUIRED_MAJOR, unsigned int REQUIRED_MINOR, unsigned int
          REQUIRED_MICRO )
     Checks that the Marpa library in use is compatible with the given
     version. Generally you will pass in the constants
     `MARPA_MAJOR_VERSION', `MARPA_MINOR_VERSION', `MARPA_MICRO_VERSION'
     as the three arguments to this function; that produces a check
     that the library in use is compatible with the version of Libmarpa
     the application or module was compiled against.  Compatibility is
     defined by two things: first the version of the running library is
     newer than the version
     REQUIRED_MAJOR.REQUIRED_MINOR.REQUIRED_MICRO.  Second the running
     library must be binary compatible with the version
     REQUIRED_MAJOR.REQUIRED_MINOR.REQUIRED_MICRO (same major version.)

     Return value: `MARPA_ERR_NONE' if the Marpa library is compatible
     with the requested version.  If the library is not compatible, one
     of the following is returned, indicating the nature of the
     mismatch:
        * `MARPA_ERR_MAJOR_VERSION_MISMATCH',

        * `MARPA_ERR_MINOR_VERSION_MISMATCH'

        * `MARPA_ERR_MICRO_VERSION_MISMATCH'

10 Configuration methods
************************

The configuration object is intended for future extensions.  These may
allow the application to override Libmarpa's memory allocation and
fatal error handling without resorting to global variables, and
therefore in a thread-safe way.  Currently, the only function of the
`Marpa_Config' class is to give `marpa_g_new()' a place to put its
error code.

   `Marpa_Config' is Libmarpa's only "major" class which is not a time
class.  There is no constructor or destructor, although `Marpa_Config'
objects *do* need to be initialized before use.  Aside from its own
accessor, `Marpa_Config' objects are only used by `marpa_g_new' and no
reference to their location is not kept in any of Libmarpa's time
objects.  The intent is to that it be convenient to have them in memory
that might be deallocated soon after `marpa_g_new' returns.  For
example, they could be put on the stack.

 -- Function: int marpa_c_init ( Marpa_Config* CONFIG)
     Initialize the CONFIG information to "safe" default values.
     Unspecified behavior will result if an initialized configuration
     is used to create a grammar.

     Return value: A non-negative value.  Always succeeds.

 -- Function: Marpa_Error_Code marpa_c_error ( Marpa_Config* CONFIG,
          const char** P_ERROR_STRING )
     Error codes are usually kept in the base grammar, which leaves
     `marpa_g_new()' no place to put its error code on failure.
     Objects of the `Marpa_Config' class provide such a place.

     Return value: The error code in CONFIG.  Always succeeds.

File: api.info,  Node: Grammar overview,  Next: Grammar constructor,  Prev: Grammar methods,  Up: Grammar methods

11.1 Overview
=============

An archtypal application has a grammar.  To create a grammar, use the
`marpa_g_new()' method.  When a grammar is no longer in use, its memory
can be freed using the `marpa_g_unref()' method.

   To be precomputed, a grammar must have one or more symbols.  To
create symbols, use the `marpa_g_symbol_new()' method.

   To be precomputed, a grammar must have one or more rules.  To create
rules, use the `marpa_g_rule_new()' and `marpa_g_sequence_new()'
methods.

   For non-trivial parsing, one or more of the symbols must be
terminals.  To mark a symbol as a terminal, use the
`marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()' method.

   To be precomputed, a grammar must have exactly one start symbol.  To
mark a symbol as the start symbol, use the `marpa_g_start_symbol_set()'
method.

   Before parsing with a grammar, it must be precomputed.  To
precompute a grammar, use the `marpa_g_precompute()' method.

11.2 Creating a new grammar
===========================

 -- Function: Marpa_Grammar marpa_g_new ( Marpa_Config* configuration )
     Creates a new grammar time object.  The returned grammar object is
     not yet precomputed, and will have no symbols and rules.  Its
     reference count will be 1.

     Unless the application calls `marpa_c_error', Libmarpa will not
     reference the location pointed to by the CONFIGURATION argument
     after `marpa_g_new' returns.  The CONFIGURATION argument may be
     `NULL', but if it is, there will be no way to determine the error
     code on failure.

     Return value: On success, the grammar object.  On failure, `NULL',
     and the error code is set in CONFIGURATION.

 -- Function: Marpa_Grammar marpa_g_ref (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Increases the reference count by 1.  Not needed by most
     applications.

     Return value: On success, the grammar object it was called with;
     `NULL' on failure.

11.4 Symbols
============

 -- Function: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_g_start_symbol (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Returns current value of the start symbol of grammar G.  The value
     is that specified in the `marpa_g_start_symbol_set()' call, if
     there has been one.

     Return value: On failure, -2; -1 if there is no start symbol yet;
     otherwise the ID of the new start symbol.

 -- Function: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_g_start_symbol_set ( Marpa_Grammar
          G, Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     Sets the start symbol of grammar G to symbol ID.

     Return value: On success, the ID of the new start symbol.  If
     SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no such symbol, -1.  On
     failure, -2.


 -- Function: int marpa_g_highest_symbol_id (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Return value: On success, the numerically largest symbol ID of G.
     On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_accessible (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     A symbol is "accessible" if it can be reached from the start
     symbol.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is accessible, 0 if
     not.  If SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no such symbol, -1.
     If the grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_nullable ( Marpa_Grammar g,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID sym_id)
     A symbol is "nullable" if it sometimes produces the empty string.
     A *nulling* symbol is always a *nullable* symbol, but not all
     *nullable* symbols are *nulling* symbols.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is nullable, 0 if not.
     If SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no such symbol, -1.  If the
     grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_nulling (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     A symbol is "nulling" if it always produces the empty string.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is nulling, 0 if not.
     If SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no such symbol, -1.  If the
     grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_productive (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     A symbol is "productive" if it can produce a string of terminals.
     All nullable symbols are considered productive.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is productive, 0 if
     not.  If the grammar If SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no
     such symbol, -1.  is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_start ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     This return value of this call indicates whether SYM_ID is the
     start symbol.

     Return value: On success, 1 if SYM_ID is the start symbol; 0
     otherwise.  If SYM_ID is well-formed, but there is no such symbol,
     -1.  On other failure, -2.


 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID, int VALUE)
     These methods, respectively, set and query the "terminal status"
     of a symbol.  To be used as an input symbol in the
     `marpa_r_alternative()' method, a symbol must be a terminal.  This
     function flags symbol SYM_ID as a terminal if VALUE is 1, or flags
     it as a non-terminal if VALUE is 0.

     Once set to a value with the `marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()'
     method, the terminal status of a symbol is "locked" at that value.
     A subsequent call to `marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()' that
     attempts to change the terminal status of SYM_ID to a value
     different from its current one will fail.  The error code will be
     `MARPA_ERR_TERMINAL_IS_LOCKED'.

     By default, a symbol is a terminal if and only if it does not
     appear on the LHS of any rule.  An attempt to flag a nulling symbol
     as a terminal will cause a failure, but this is not necesssarily
     detected before precomputation.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is a terminal symbol
     after the call, 0 otherwise.  If VALUE is not 0 or 1; if the
     terminal status is locked and VALUE is different from its current
     value; if the grammar G is precomputed; or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_valued ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYMBOL_ID)
 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_valued_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYMBOL_ID, int value)
     These methods, respectively, set and query the "valued status" of
     a symbol.  Once set to a value with the
     `marpa_g_symbol_is_valued_set()' method, the valued status of a
     symbol is "locked" at that value.  It cannot thereafter be changed.
     Subsequent calls to `marpa_g_symbol_is_valued_set()' for the same
     SYM_ID will fail, leaving SYM_ID's valued status unchanged, unless
     VALUE is the same as the locked-in value.

     Return value: On success, 1 if the symbol SYMBOL_ID is valued
     after the call, 0 if not.  If the valued status is locked and VALUE
     is different from the current status, -2.  If VALUE is not 0 or 1;

11.5 Rules
==========

 -- Function: int marpa_g_highest_rule_id (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Return value: On success, the numerically largest rule ID of G.
     On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_accessible (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID)
     A rule is "accessible" if it can be reached from the start symbol.
     A rule is accessible if and only if its LHS symbol is accessible.
     The start rule is always an accessible rule.

     Return value: On success, 1 if rule RULE_ID is accessible, 0 if
     not.  If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.
     If the grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_nullable ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULEID)
     A rule is "nullable" if it sometimes produces the empty string.  A
     *nulling* rule is always a *nullable* rule, but not all *nullable*
     rules are *nulling* rules.

     Return value: On success, 1 if rule RULEID is nullable, 0 if not.
     If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.  If the
     grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_nulling (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULEID)
     A rule is "nulling" if it always produces the empty string.

     Return value: On success, 1 if rule RULEID is nulling, 0 if not.
     If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.  If the
     grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_loop (Marpa_Grammar G, Marpa_Rule_ID
          RULE_ID)
     A rule is a loop rule if it non-trivially produces the string of
     length one which consists only of its LHS symbol.  Such a
     derivation takes the parse back to where it started, hence the
     term "loop".  "Non-trivially" means the zero-step derivation does
     not count -- the derivation must have at least one step.

     The presence of a loop rule makes a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
     and applications will typically want to treat them as fatal errors.
     But nothing forces an application to do this, and Marpa will
     successfully parse and evaluate grammars with loop rules.

     Return value: On success, 1 if rule RULE_ID is a loop rule, 0 if
     not.  If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.
     If the grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_productive (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID)
     A rule is "productive" if it can produce a string of terminals.
     An rule is productive if and only if all the symbols on its RHS
     are productive.  The empty string counts as a string of terminals,
     so that a nullable rule is always a productive rule.  For that
     same reason, an empty rule is considered productive.

     Return value: On success, 1 if rule RULE_ID is productive, 0 if
     not.  If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.
     If the grammar is not precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_length ( Marpa_Grammar G, Marpa_Rule_ID
          RULE_ID)
     The length of a rule is the number of symbols on its RHS.

     Return value: On success, the length of rule RULE_ID.  On failure,
     -2.

 -- Function: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_g_rule_lhs ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID)
     Return value: On success, the LHS symbol of rule RULE_ID.  If
     RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.  On other
     failure, -2.

 -- Function: Marpa_Rule_ID marpa_g_rule_new (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID LHS_ID, Marpa_Symbol_ID *RHS_IDS, int LENGTH)
     Creates a new external rule in grammar G.  The LHS symbol is
     LHS_ID, and there are LENGTH symbols on the RHS.  The RHS symbols
     are in an array pointed to by RHS_IDS.

     Possible failures, with their error codes, include:
        * `MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE': The LHS symbol is the
          same as that of a sequence rule.

        * `MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_RULE': The new rule would duplicate
          another BNF rule.  Another BNF rule is considered the
          duplicate of the new one, if its LHS symbol is the same as
          symbol LHS_ID, if its length is the same as LENGTH, and if
          its RHS symbols match one for one those in the array of
          symbols RHS_IDS.

     Return value:  On success, the ID of new external rule.  On
     failure, -2.

 -- Function: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_g_rule_rhs ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID, int IX)
     Returns the ID of the symbol in position IX in the RHS of rule
     RULE_ID.  The RHS position, IX, is zero-based.

     Return value: On success, the ID of the symbol in position IX on
     the rules RHS.  If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such
     rule, -1.  If IX is greater than or equal to the length of the
     rule, or on other failure, -2.

11.6 Sequences
==============

 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_is_proper_separation ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID)
     Return value: On success, if rule RULE_ID is not a sequence rule,
     0.  On success, if rule RULE_ID is a sequence rule where the
     proper separation flag is set, 1.  On success, if rule RULE_ID is
     a sequence rule where the proper separation flag is *not* set, 0.
     If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.  On
     failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_sequence_min ( Marpa_Grammar G, Marpa_Rule_ID
          RULE_ID)
     Returns the mininum length of a sequence rule.  This accessor can
     be also be used to test whether or not a rule is a sequence rule.
     -1 is returned if and only if the rule is valid but not a sequence
     rule.

     Return value: If rule RULE_ID is a sequence rule, its minimum
     length.  If rule RULE_ID is valid, but is not the rule ID of
     sequence rule, -1.  If RULE_ID is well-formed, but there is no
     such rule, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: Marpa_Rule_ID marpa_g_sequence_new (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID LHS_ID, Marpa_Symbol_ID RHS_ID,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SEPARATOR_ID, int MIN, int FLAGS )
     Adds a new sequence rule to grammar G.  Sequence rules do not add
     to the classes of grammar parsed by Libmarpa -- a sequence can
     always be written as BNF rules.  When a rule is created with the
     `marpa_g_sequence_new()' method, Libmarpa will understand that it
     is a sequence, and will optimize accordingly.  The speedup is
     often considerable.

     The sequence is LHS_ID, and the item to be repeated in the
     sequence is RHS_ID.  The sequence must be repeated at least MIN
     times, where MIN is 0 or 1.  If SEPARATOR_ID is non-negative, it
     is a separator symbol.

     If `flags & MARPA_PROPER_SEPARATION' is non-zero, separation is
     "proper", that is, a trailing separator is not allowed.  The term
     "proper" is based on the idea that properly-speaking, separators
     should actually separate items.

     Some higher-level Marpa interfaces offer the ability to discard
     separators in the semantics, and in fact will do this by default.
     At the Libmarpa level, sequences always "keep separators".  It is
     up to the programmer to arrange to discard separators, if that is
     what is desired.

     The sequence RHS, or item, is restricted to a single symbol, and
     that symbol cannot be nullable.  If SEPARATOR_ID is a symbol, it
     also cannot be a nullable symbol.  Nullables on the RHS of
     sequences are restricted because they lead to highly ambiguous
     grammars.  Grammars of this kind are allowed by Libmarpa, but they
     must be expressed using BNF rules, not sequence rules.  This is
     for two reasons: First, sequence optimizations would not work in
     the presence of nullables.  Second, since it is not completely
     clear what an application intends when it asks for a sequence of
     identical items, some of which are nullable, the user's intent can
     be more clearly expressed directly in BNF.

     The LHS symbol cannot be the LHS of any other rule, whether a BNF
     rule or a sequence rule.  On an attempt to create an sequence rule
     with a duplicate LHS, `marpa_g_sequence_new()' fails, setting the
     error code to `MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE'.

     Return value:  On success, the ID of the external rule.  On
     failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_sequence_separator ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID)
     Return value: If rule RULE_ID is a sequence rule, its separator.
     If rule RULE_ID is a sequence rule,, but there is no separator, -1.
     If RULE_ID is not a sequence rule, does not exist or is not
     well-formed; or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_symbol_is_counted (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID)
     A symbol is "counted" if it appears on the RHS of a sequence rule,
     or if it is used as the separator symbol of a sequence rule.

     Return value: On success, 1 if symbol SYM_ID is counted, 0 if not.
     On failure, -2.

11.7 Ranks
==========

 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_rule_rank ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID rule_id)
 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_rule_rank_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID, Marpa_Rank RANK)
     These methods, respectively, set and query the rank of a rule
     RULE_ID.  When RULE_ID is created, its rank initialized to the
     default rank of the grammar.

     Initially, the default rank of the grammar is 0.  Methods to reset
     the grammar's default rank are currently in the experimental stage.

     Return value: On success, the rank *after* the call.  If the
     grammar has been precomputed, or on other failure, -2.


 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_null_high ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID rule_id)
 -- Function: int marpa_g_rule_null_high_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID, int FLAG)
     These methods, respectively, set and discover the "null ranks
     high" setting of the rule RULE_ID.  The "null ranks high" setting
     is either 0 or 1.  When RULE_ID is created, its "null ranks high"
     setting is initialized to 0.

     The "null ranks high" setting affects the ranking of rules with
     properly nullable symbols on their right hand side.  If a rule has
     properly nullable symbols on its RHS, each instance in which it
     appears in a parse will have a pattern of nulled and non-nulled
     symbols.  Such a pattern is called a "null variant".

     If the "null ranks high" setting is 0 (the default), nulled
     symbols rank low.  If the "null ranks high" setting is 1, nulled
     symbols rank high.  Ranking of a null variants is done from
     left-to-right.

     Return value: On success, the setting of the "null ranks high"
     flag *after* the call.  If the grammar has been precomputed, or on
     other failure, -2.

11.8 Precomputing the Grammar
=============================

 -- Function: int marpa_g_precompute (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Precomputation is necessary for a recognizer to be generated from
     a grammar.  On success, `marpa_g_precompute' returns a non-negative
     number to indicate that it precomputed the grammar without issues.
     On failure, `marpa_g_precompute' returns -2.

     Precomputation may return one or more events, which may be queried
     using the `marpa_g_event()' method.  At this point events only
     occur when failure is reported, and events always report issues.
     But application writers should expect future versions to have
     events which are reported on success, as well as events which do
     not represent issues.

     A `MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES' event occurs when there are infinite
     loop rules (cycles) in the grammar.  The presence of one or more
     of these will cause failure to be reported, but will not prevent
     the grammar from being precomputed.

     Each `MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE' event is a symbol which is a
     nullable on the right hand side of a sequence rule -- a "counted"
     symbol.  The presence of one or more of these will cause failure
     to be reported, and will prevent the grammar from being
     precomputed.  So that the programmer can fix several at once,
     these failures are delayed until events are created for all of the
     counted nullables.

     Each `MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL' event is a nulling symbol
     which is also flagged as a terminal.  Since terminals cannot be of
     zero length, this is a logical impossibility.  The presence of one
     or more of these will cause failure to be reported, and will
     prevent the grammar from being precomputed.  So that the
     programmer can fix several at once, the failure is delayed until
     events are created for all of the counted nullables.

     Precomputation involves freezing and then thoroughly checking the
     grammar.  Among the reasons for precomputation to fail are the
     following:

        * `MARPA_ERR_NO_RULES': The grammar has no rules.

        * `MARPA_ERR_NO_START_SYMBOL': No start symbol was specified.

        * `MARPA_ERR_INVALID_START_SYMBOL': A start symbol ID was
          specified, but it is not the ID of a valid symbol.

        * `MARPA_ERR_START_NOT_LHS': The start symbol is not on the LHS
          of any rule.

        * `MARPA_ERR_UNPRODUCTIVE_START': The start symbol is not
          productive.

        * `MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE': A symbol on the RHS of a
          sequence rule is nullable.  Libmarpa does not allow this.

        * `MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL': A terminal is also a nulling
          symbol.  Libmarpa does not allow this.

     More details of these can be found under the description of the
     appropriate code.  *Note External error codes::.

     `marpa_g_precompute()' is unusual in that it is possible to treat
     one of its failures as "advisory", and to proceed with parsing.  If
     `marpa_g_precompute()' fails with an error code of
     `MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE', parsing can proceed, just as it
     typically would for success.  The grammar will have been
     precomputed, as calling the `marpa_g_is_precomputed()' method will
     confirm.

     Most applications, however, will want to simply treat failure with
     `MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE', as simply another failure, and fix
     the cycles before parsing.  Cycles make a grammar infinitely
     ambiguous, and are considered useless in current practice.  Cycles
     make processing the grammar less efficient, sometimes considerably
     so.  Detection of cycles is returned as failure because that is by
     far the convenient thing to do for the vast majority of
     applications.

     Return value: On success, a non-negative number.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_is_precomputed (Marpa_Grammar G)
     Return value: On success, 1 if grammar G is already precomputed, 0
     otherwise.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_has_cycle (Marpa_Grammar G)
     This function allows the application to determine if grammar G has
     a cycle.  As mentioned, most applications will want to treat these
     as fatal errors.  To determine which rules are in the cycle,
     `marpa_g_rule_is_loop()' can be used.

     Return value: On success, 1 if the grammar has a cycle, 0
     otherwise.  On failure, -2.

12.1 Overview
=============

An archtypal application uses a recognizer to read input.  To create a
recognizer, use the `marpa_r_new()' method.  When a recognizer is no
longer in use, its memory can be freed using the `marpa_r_unref()'
method.

   To make a recognizer ready for input, use the
`marpa_r_start_input()' method.

   The recognizer starts with its current earleme at location 0.  To
read a token at the current earleme, use the `marpa_r_alternative()'
call.

   To complete the processing of the current earleme, and move forward
to a new one, use the `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' call.

12.2 Creating a new recognizer
==============================

 -- Function: Marpa_Recognizer marpa_r_new ( Marpa_Grammar G )
     Creates a new recognizer.  The reference count of the recognizer
     will be 1.  The reference count of G, the base grammar, will be
     incremented by one.

     Return value:  On success, the newly created recognizer.  If G is
     not precomputed, or on other failure, `NULL'.

12.3 Keeping the reference count of a recognizer
================================================

 -- Function: Marpa_Recognizer marpa_r_ref (Marpa_Recognizer R)
     Increases the reference count by 1.  Not needed by most
     applications.

     Return value: On success, the recognizer object, R.  On failure,
     `NULL'.

 -- Function: void marpa_r_unref (Marpa_Recognizer R)
     Decreases the reference count by 1, destroying R once the
     reference count reaches zero.  When R is destroyed, the reference
     count of its base grammar is decreased by one.  If this takes the
     reference count of the base grammar to zero, it too is destroyed.

12.4 Life cycle mutators
========================

 -- Function: int marpa_r_start_input (Marpa_Recognizer R)
     Makes R ready to accept input.

     Return value:  On success, a non-negative value.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_alternative (Marpa_Recognizer R,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID TOKEN_ID, int VALUE, int LENGTH)
     Reads a token into R.  The token will start at the current earleme.
     Libmarpa allows tokens to be ambiguous, to be of variable length
     and to overlap.  TOKEN_ID is the symbol ID of the token, which
     must be a terminal.  LENGTH is the length of the token.

     VALUE is an integer that represents the value of the token.  In
     applications where the token's actual value is not an integer, it
     is expected that the application will use this value as a
     "virtual" value, perhaps finding the actual value by using VALUE
     to index an array.  VALUE is not used inside Libmarpa -- it is
     simply stored to be returned by the valuator as a convenience for
     the application.  Some applications may prefer to track token
     values on their own, perhaps based on the earleme location and
     TOKEN_ID, instead of using Libmarpa's token values.

     A VALUE of 0 has special significance -- it indicates that the
     token is unvalued -- that its value is allowed to be unpredictable.
     Note that if a token is unvalued, it must be the case, not just
     that Libmarpa need not care about its value, but also that *the
     application* does not care about the value of the token.  When a
     token is unvalued, Libmarpa optimizes away the valuator steps that
     give the application an opportunity to provide a value for that
     token.  Applications that do not use Libmarpa's token values, but
     that *do* care about the token's value, must tell Libmarpa not to
     optimize away the relevant valuator steps.  An application can do
     this by letting VALUE be any non-zero integer.

     When VALUE in a call to `marpa_r_alternative()' is 0, symbol
     TOKEN_ID is considered to have been used as an unvalued symbol.
     When VALUE in a call to `marpa_r_alternative()' is not zero,
     symbol TOKEN_ID is considered to have been used as an valued
     symbol.  On the first read by `marpa_r_alternative()', if symbol
     TOKEN_ID is used as a valued symbol, the valued status of symbol
     TOKEN_ID will be set to 1 and locked.  On the first read by
     `marpa_r_alternative()', if symbol TOKEN_ID is used as a unvalued
     symbol, the valued status of symbol TOKEN_ID will be set to 0 and
     locked.

     If the valued status of symbol TOKEN_ID is locked at 0, it is a
     failure if that symbol is used as an valued symbol.  If the valued
     status of symbol TOKEN_ID is locked at 1, it is a failure if that
     symbol is used as an unvalued symbol.

     When `marpa_r_alternative()' is successful, the value of the
     furthest earleme is set to the greater of its value before the
     call, and CURRENT+LENGTH, where CURRENT is the value of the
     current earleme.  The values of the current and latest earlemes
     are unchanged by calls to `marpa_r_alternative()'.

     Several error codes leave the recognizer in a fully recoverable
     state, allowing the application to retry the
     `marpa_r_alternative()' method.  Retry is efficient, and quite
     useable as a parsing technique.  The error code of primary
     interest from this point of view is
     `MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID', which indicates that the token
     was not accepted because of its token ID.  Retry after this
     condition is used in several applications, and is called "the Ruby
     Slippers technique".

     The error codes `MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_TOKEN',
     `MARPA_ERR_NO_TOKEN_EXPECTED_HERE' and
     `MARPA_ERR_INACCESSIBLE_TOKEN' also leave the recognizer in a
     fully recoverable state, and may also be useable for the Ruby
     Slippers or similar techniques.  At this writing, the author knows
     of no applications which attempt to recover from these errors.

     Return value:  On success, `MARPA_ERR_NONE'.  On failure, some
     other error code.


 -- Function: Marpa_Earleme marpa_r_earleme_complete (Marpa_Recognizer
          R)
     This method does the final processing for the current earleme.  It
     then advances the current earleme by one.  Note that
     `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' may be called even when no tokens
     have been read at the current earleme -- in the
     character-per-earleme input model, for example, tokens can span
     many characters and, if the input is unambiguous over that span,
     there will be no other tokens that start inside it.

     As mentioned, `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' always advances the
     current earleme, incrementing its value by 1.  This means that
     value of the current earleme after the call will be the one plus
     the value of the earleme processed by the call to
     `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.  If any token was accepted at the
     earleme being processed, `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' creates a
     new Earley set which will be the latest Earley set and, after the
     call, the latest earleme will be equal to the new current earleme.
     If no token was accepted at the earleme being processed, no Earley
     set is created, and the value of the latest earleme remains
     unchanged.  The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
     a call to `marpa_r_earleme_complete()'.

     During this method, one or more events may occur.  On success,
     this function returns the number of events generated, but it is
     important to note that events may be created whether earleme
     completion fails or succeeds.  When this method fails, the
     application must call `marpa_g_event()' if it wants to determine
     if any events occurred.  Since the reason for failure to complete
     an earleme is often detailed in the events, applications that fail
     will often be at least as interested in the events as those that
     succeed.

     `MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED' indicates that the parse is exhausted --
     that no input will be accepted at later earlemes.

     The `MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD' event indicates that an
     application-settable threshold on the number of Earley items has
     been reached or exceeded.  What this means depends on the
     application, but when the default threshold is exceeded, it means
     that it is very likely that the time and space resources consumed
     by the parse will prove excessive.

     Note that an exhausted parse may be returned as a failure, or it
     may be an event returned on success, depending on the
     circumstances.  If `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' is called with the
     furthest earleme equal to the current earleme, a failure will
     result whose error code is `MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED'.  A failure
     of this sort can happen if the last call to
     `marpa_r_earleme_complete()' left the current earleme equal to the
     furthest earleme, and no alternatives were added at the current
     earleme.  Note that when a parse fails due to exhaustion, it may
     have succeeded at earlier earlemes.

     On the other hand, a parse can be exhausted on success.  In this
     case, a new Earley set is created, and the earleme advanced, but
     no input will be possible at the new current earleme.  It is quite
     common for a parse to accept no more input when it succeeds.  Many
     practical grammars are designed so that a successful parse cannot
     be extended.

     Return value:  On success, the number of events generated.  On
     failure, -2.

12.5 Location accessors
=======================

 -- Function: Marpa_Earleme marpa_r_earleme ( Marpa_Recognizer R,
          Marpa_Earley_Set_ID SET_ID)
     In the default, token-stream model, Earley set ID and earleme are
     always equal, but this is not the case in other input models.
     (The ID of an Earley set ID is also called its ordinal.)  If there
     is no Earley set whose ID is SET_ID, `marpa_r_earleme()' fails.
     If SET_ID was negative, the error code is set to
     `MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION'.  If SET_ID is greater than the
     ordinal of the latest Earley set, the error code is set to
     `MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION'.

     At this writing, there is no method for the inverse operation
     (conversion of an earleme to an Earley set ID).  One consideration
     in writing such a method is that not all earlemes correspond to
     Earley sets.  Applications that want to map earlemes to Earley
     sets will have no trouble if they are using the standard input
     model -- the Earley set ID is always exactly equal to the earleme
     in that model.  For other applications that want an earleme-to-ID
     mapping, the most general method is create an ID-to-earleme array
     using the `marpa_r_earleme()' method and invert it.

     Return value: On success, the earleme corresponding to Earley set
     SET_ID.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: `unsigned int' marpa_r_current_earleme (Marpa_Recognizer
          R)
     Return value: If input has started, the current earleme.  If input
     has not started, -1.  Always succeeds.

 -- Function: Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_r_latest_earley_set
          (Marpa_Recognizer R)
     This method returns the Earley set ID (ordinal) of the latest
     Earley set.  Applications that want the value of the latest
     earleme can convert this value using the `marpa_r_earleme()'
     method.

     Return value: On success, the ID of the latest Earley set.  Always
     succeeds.

 -- Function: `unsigned int' marpa_r_furthest_earleme (Marpa_Recognizer
          R)
     Return value: On success, the furthest earleme.  Always succeeds.

===============================

 -- Function: int marpa_r_earley_item_warning_threshold
          (Marpa_Recognizer R)
 -- Function: int marpa_r_earley_item_warning_threshold_set
          (Marpa_Recognizer R, int THRESHOLD)
     These methods, respectively, report and set the Earley item
     warning threshold.  The "Earley item warning threshold" is a
     number that is compared with the count of Earley items in each
     Earley set.  When it is matched or exceeded, a
     `MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD' event is created.

     If THRESHOLD is zero or less, an unlimited number of Earley items
     will be allowed without warning.  This will rarely be what the
     user wants.

     By default, Libmarpa calculates a value based on the grammar.  The
     formula Libmarpa uses is the result of some experience, and most
     applications will be happy with it.

     Return value: The value that the Earley item warning threshold has
     after the method call is finished.  Always succeeds.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_expected_symbol_event_set ( Marpa_Recognizer
          R, Marpa_Symbol_ID SYMBOL_ID, int VALUE)
     Sets the "expected symbol event bit" for SYMBOL_ID to VALUE.  A
     recognizer event is created whenever symbol SYMBOL_ID is expected
     at the current earleme.  if and only if the expected symbol event
     bit for SYMBOL_ID is 1.  The "expected symbol event bit" must be 1
     or 0.

     By default, the "expected symbol event bit" is 0.  It is an error
     to attempt to set the "expected symbol event bit" to 1 for a
     nulling symbol, an inaccessible symbol, or an unproductive symbol.

     Return value: The value of the event bit after the method call is
     finished.  -2 if SYMBOL_ID is not the ID of a valid symbol; if it
     is the ID of an nulling, inaccessible for unproductive symbol; or
     on other failure.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_terminals_expected ( Marpa_Recognizer R,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID* BUFFER)
     Returns a list of the ID's of the symbols that are acceptable as
     tokens at the current earleme.  BUFFER is expected to be large
     enough to hold the result.  This is guaranteed to be the case if
     the buffer is large enough to hold a number of `Marpa_Symbol_ID''s
     that is greater than or equal to the number of symbols in the
     grammar.

     Return value:  On success, the number of `Marpa_Symbol_ID''s in
     BUFFER.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_is_exhausted (Marpa_Recognizer R)
     A parser is "exhausted" if it cannot accept any more input.  Both
     successful and failed parses can be exhausted.  In many grammars,
     the parse is always exhausted as soon as it succeeds.  Good parses
     may also exist at earlemes prior to the current one.

     Return value: 1 if the parser is exhausted, 0 otherwise.  Always
     succeeds.

13 Progress reports
*******************

An important advantage of the Marpa algorithm is the ability to easily
get full information about the state of the parse.

   To start a progress report, use the
`marpa_r_progress_report_start()' command.  Only one progress report
can be in use at any one time.

   To get the information in a progress report, it is necessary to step
through the progress report items.  To get the data for the current
progress report item, and advance to the next one, use the
`marpa_r_progress_item()' method.

   To destroy a progress report, freeing the memory it uses, call the
`marpa_r_progress_report_finish()' method.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_progress_report_start ( Marpa_Recognizer R,
          Marpa_Earley_Set_ID SET_ID)
     Initializes a report of the progress at Earley set SET_ID for
     recognizer R.  If a progress report already exists, it is
     destroyed and its memory is freed.  Initially, the progress report
     is positioned before its first item.

     If no Earley set with ID SET_ID exists,
     `marpa_r_progress_report_start()' fails.  The error code is
     `MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION' if SET_ID is negative.  The error
     code is `MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION' if SET_ID is greater
     than the ID of the latest Earley set.

     Return value: On success, the number of report items available.
     If the recognizer has not been started; if SET_ID does not exist;
     or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_r_progress_report_finish ( Marpa_Recognizer R )
     Destroys the report of the progress at Earley set SET_ID for
     recognizer R, freeing the memory and other resources.  It is often
     not necessary to call this method.  Any previously existing
     progress report is destroyed automatically whenever a new progress
     report is started, and when the recognizer is destroyed.

     Return value: -2 if no progress report has been started, or on
     other failure.  On success, a non-negative value.

 -- Function: Marpa_Rule_ID marpa_r_progress_item ( Marpa_Recognizer R,
          int* POSITION, Marpa_Earley_Set_ID* ORIGIN )
     This method allows access to the data for the next item of a
     progress report.  If there are no more progress report items, it
     returns -1 as a termination indicator and sets the error code to
     `MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_EXHAUSTED'.  Either the termination
     indicator, or the item count returned by
     `marpa_r_progress_report_start()', can be used to determine when
     the last item has been seen.

     On success, the dot position is returned in the location pointed
     to by the POSITION argument, and the origin is returned in the
     location pointed to by the ORIGIN argument.  On failure, the
     locations pointed to by the POSITION and ORIGIN arguments are
     unchanged.

     Return value: On success, the rule ID of the next progress report
     item.  If there are no more progress report items, -1.  If either
     the POSITION or the ORIGIN argument is `NULL', or on other
     failure, -2.

14.1 Overview
=============

A bocage is structure containing the full set of parses found by
processing the input according to the grammar.  The bocage structure is
new with Libmarpa, but is very similar in purpose to the more familar
parse forests.

   To create a bocage, use the `marpa_b_new()' method.

   When a bocage is no longer in use, its memory can be freed using the
`marpa_b_unref()' method.

==========================

 -- Function: Marpa_Bocage marpa_b_new (Marpa_Recognizer R,
          Marpa_Earley_Set_ID EARLEY_SET_ID)
     Creates a new bocage object, with a reference count of 1.  The
     reference count of its parent recognizer object, R, is increased
     by 1.  If there is no parse ending at Earley set EARLEY_SET_ID,
     `marpa_b_new' fails and the error code is set to
     `MARPA_ERR_NO_PARSE'.

     Return value: On success, the new bocage object.  On failure,
     `NULL'.

=======================

 -- Function: Marpa_Bocage marpa_b_ref (Marpa_Bocage B)
     Increases the reference count by 1.  Not needed by most
     applications.

     Return value: On success, B.  On failure, `NULL'.

 -- Function: void marpa_b_unref (Marpa_Bocage B)
     Decreases the reference count by 1, destroying B once the
     reference count reaches zero.  When B is destroyed, the reference
     count of its parent recognizer is decreased by 1.  If this takes
     the reference count of the parent recognizer to zero, it too is
     destroyed.  If the parent recognizer is destroyed, the reference
     count of its base grammar is decreased by 1.  If this takes the
     reference count of the base grammar to zero, it too is destroyed.

15.1 Overview
=============

Before iterating the parses in the bocage, they must be ordered.  To
create an ordering, use the `marpa_o_new()' method.  When an ordering
is no longer in use, its memory can be freed using the
`marpa_o_unref()' method.

   An ordering is "frozen" once the first tree iterator is created
using it.  A frozen ordering cannot be changed.

   As of this writing, the only methods to order parses are internal
and undocumented.  This is expected to change.

15.2 Creating an ordering
=========================

 -- Function: Marpa_Order marpa_o_new ( Marpa_Bocage B)
     Creates a new ordering object, with a reference count of 1.  The
     reference count of its parent bocage object, B, is increased by 1.

     Return value: On success, the new ordering object.  On failure,
     `NULL'.

15.3 Reference counting
=======================

 -- Function: Marpa_Order marpa_o_ref ( Marpa_Order O)
     Increases the reference count by 1.  Not needed by most
     applications.

     Return value: On success, O.  On failure, `NULL'.

 -- Function: void marpa_o_unref ( Marpa_Order O)
     Decreases the reference count by 1, destroying O once the
     reference count reaches zero.  Beginning with O's parent bocage,
     Libmarpa then proceeds up the chain of parent objects.  Every time
     a child is destroyed, the reference count of its parent is
     decreased by 1.  Every time the reference count of an object is
     decreased by 1, if that reference count is now zero, that object
     is destroyed.  Libmarpa follows this chain of decrements and
     destructions as required, all the way back to the base grammar, if
     necessary.

15.4 Non-default ordering
=========================

 -- Function: int marpa_o_high_rank_only_set ( Marpa_Order O, int FLAG)
 -- Function: int marpa_o_high_rank_only ( Marpa_Order O)
     These methods, respectively, set and discover the "high rank only"
     flag of ordering O.  A flag of 1 indicates that, when ranking, all
     choices should be discarded except those of the highest rank.  A
     valued status of 0 indicates that no choices should be discarded
     on the basis of their rank.

     Return value:  On success, the  value of the "high rank only" flag
     *after* the call.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_o_rank ( Marpa_Order O )
     By default, the ordering of parse trees is arbitrary.  This method
     causes the ordering to be ranked according to the ranks of symbols
     and rules, the "null ranks high" flags of the rules, and the "high
     rank only" flag of the ordering.  Once this method returns, the
     ordering is frozen.

     Return value:  On success, a non-negative value.  On failure, -2.

File: api.info,  Node: Tree overview,  Next: Tree constructor,  Prev: Tree methods,  Up: Tree methods

16.1 Overview
=============

Once the bocage has an ordering, the parses trees can be iterated.
Marpa's "parse tree iterators" iterate the parse trees contained in a
bocage object.  In Libmarpa, "parse tree iterators" are usually just
called "trees".

   To create a tree, use the `marpa_t_new()' method.  A newly created
tree iterator is positioned before the first parse tree.  When a tree
iterator is no longer in use, its memory can be freed using the
`marpa_t_unref()' method.

   To position a newly created tree iterator at the first parse tree,
use the `marpa_t_next()' method.  Once the tree iterator is positioned
at a parse tree, the same `marpa_t_next()' method is used to position
it to the next parse tree.

16.2 Creating a new tree iterator
=================================

 -- Function: Marpa_Tree marpa_t_new (Marpa_Order O)
     Creates a new tree iterator, with a reference count of 1.  The
     reference count of its parent ordering object, O, is increased by
     1.

     When initialized, a tree iterator is positioned before the first
     parse tree.  To position the tree iterator to the first parse, the
     application must call `marpa_t_next()'.

     Return value:  On success, a newly created tree.  On failure,
     `NULL'.

     applications.

     Return value: On success, T.  On failure, `NULL'.

 -- Function: void marpa_t_unref (Marpa_Tree T)
     Decreases the reference count by 1, destroying T once the
     reference count reaches zero.  Beginning with T's parent ordering,
     Libmarpa then proceeds up the chain of parent objects.  Every time
     a child is destroyed, the reference count of its parent is
     decreased by 1.  Every time the reference count of an object is
     decreased by 1, if that reference count is now zero, that object
     is destroyed.  Libmarpa follows this chain of decrements and
     destructions as required, all the way back to the base grammar, if
     necessary.



File: api.info,  Node: Tree iteration,  Prev: Tree reference counting,  Up: Tree methods

16.4 Iterating through the trees
================================

 -- Function: int marpa_t_next ( Marpa_Tree T)
     Positions T at the next parse tree in the iteration.  Tree
     iterators are initialized to the position before the first parse
     tree, so this method must be called before creating a valuator
     from a tree.

     If a tree iterator is positioned after the last parse, the tree is
     said to be "exhausted".  A tree iterator for a bocage with no
     parse trees is considered to be "exhausted" when initialized.  If
     the tree iterator is exhausted, `marpa_t_next()' returns -1 as a
     termination indicator, and sets the error code to
     `MARPA_ERR_TREE_EXHAUSTED'.

     Return value: On success, a non-negative value.  If the tree
     iterator is exhausted, -1.  On failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_t_parse_count ( Marpa_Tree T)
     The parse counter counts the number of parse trees traversed so
     far.  The count includes the current iteration of the tree, so
     that a value of 0 indicates that the tree iterator is at its
     initialized position, before the first parse tree.

     Return value: The number of parses traversed so far.  Always
     succeeds.

File: api.info,  Node: Value overview,  Next: How to use the valuator,  Prev: Value methods,  Up: Value methods

17.1 Overview
=============

The archetypal application needs a value object (or "valuator") to
produce the value of the parse.  To create a valuator, use the
`marpa_v_new()' method.  When a valuator is no longer in use, its
memory can be freed using the `marpa_v_unref()' method.

   By default, Libmarpa assumes that non-terminal symbols have no
semantics.  The archetypal application will need to register symbols
that contain semantics.  The primary method for doing this is
`marpa_v_symbol_is_valued()'.  Applications will typically register
semantics by rule, and these applications will find the
`marpa_v_rule_is_valued()' method more convenient.

   The application is required to maintain the stack, and the
application is also required to implement most of the semantics,
including the evaluation of rules.  Libmarpa's valuator provides
instructions to the application on how to manipulate the stack.  To
iterate through this series of instructions, use the `marpa_v_step()'
method.

   `marpa_v_step()' returns the type of step.  Most step types has
values associated with them.  To access these values use the methods
described in the section *note Basic step accessors::.  How to perform
the steps is described in the sections *note How to use the valuator::
and *note Stepping through the valuator::.


File: api.info,  Node: How to use the valuator,  Next: Advantages of step-driven valuation,  Prev: Value overview,  Up: Value methods

17.2 How to use the valuator
============================

Libmarpa's valuator provides the application with "steps", which are
instructions for stack manipulation.  Libmarpa itself does not maintain
a stack.  This leaves the upper layer in total control of the stack and
the values which are placed on it.

   As example may make this clearer.  Suppose the evalution is at a
place in the parse tree where an addition is being performed.  Libmarpa
does not know that the operation is an addition.  It will tell the
application that rule number R is to be applied to the arguments at
stack locations N and N+1, and that the result is to placed in stack
location N.

   In this system the application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule R and determines that it is an addition.
The application can do this by using R as an index into an array of
callbacks, or by any other method it chooses.  Let's assume a callback
implements the semantics for rule R.  Libmarpa has told the application
that two arguments are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations N and N+1 in the stack.  They might be the numbers 42 and
711.  So the callback is called with its two arguments, and produces a
return value, let's say, 753.  Libmarpa has told the application that
the result belongs at location N in the stack, so the application
writes 753 to location N.

   Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics, the operation for
rule R could be string concatenation instead of addition.  Or, if it is
addition, it could allow for its arguments to be floating point or
complex numbers.  Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers, strings,
complex numbers, or polymorphic objects which are capable of being any
of these things and more.

17.3 Advantages of step-driven valuation
========================================

Step-driven valuation hides Libmarpa's grammar rewrites from the
application, and is quite efficient.  Libmarpa knows which rules are
sequences.  Based on the individual symbol's valued statuses, Libmarpa
also knows which rules and terminals have values that it need not
bother tracking.  Libmarpa optimizes stack manipulations based on this
knowledge.  Long sequences, as well as unvalued rules and symbols, are
very common in practical grammars.  For these, the stack manipulations
suggested by Libmarpa's step-driven valuator will be significantly
faster than the traditional stack evaluation algorithm.

   Step-driven evalution has another advantage.  To illustrate this,
consider what is a very common case: The semantics are implemented in a
higher-level language, using callbacks.  If Libmarpa did not use
step-driven valuation, it would need to provide for this case.  But for
generality, Libmarpa would have to deal in C callbacks.  Therefore, a
middle layer would have to create C language wrappers for the callbacks
in the higher level language.

   The implementation that results is this: The higher level language
would need to wrap each callback in C.  When calling Libmarpa, it would
pass the wrappered callback.  Libmarpa would then need to call the C
language "wrappered" callback.  Next, the wrapper would call the
higher-level language callback.  The return value, which would be data
native to the higher-level language, would need to be passed to the C
language wrapper, which will need to make arrangements for it to be
based back to the higher-level language when appropriate.

   A setup like this is not terribly efficient.  And exception handling
across language boundaries would be very tricky.  But neither of these
is the worst problem.

   Callbacks are hard to debug.  Wrappered callbacks are even worse.
Calls made across language boundaries are harder yet to debug.  In the
system described above, by the time a return value is finally consumed,
a language boundary will have been crossed four times.

   How do programmers deal with difficulties like this?  Usually, by
doing the absolute minimum possible in the callbacks.  A horrific
debugging enviroment can become a manageable one if there is next to no
code to be debugged.  And this can be accomplished by doing as much as
possible in pre- and post-processing.

   In essence, callbacks force applications to do most of the
programming via side effects.  One need not be a functional programming
purist to find this a very undesirable style of design to force on an
application.  But the ability to debug can make the difference between
code that does work and code that does not.  Unfairly or not, code is
rarely considered well-designed when it does not work.

   So, while step-driven valuation seems a roundabout approach, it is
simpler and more direct than the likely alternatives.  And there is
something to be said for pushing semantics up to the higher levels --
they can be expected to know more about it.

   These advantages of step-driven valuation are strictly in the
context of a low-level interface.  The author is under no illusion that
direct use of Libmarpa's valuator will be found satisfactory by most
application programmers, even those using the C language.  The author
certainly avoids using step-driven valuation directly.  Libmarpa's
valuator is intended to be used via an upper layer, one which *does*
know about semantics.

17.4 Maintaining the stack
==========================

This section discusses in detail the requirements for maintaining the
stack.  In some cases, such as implementation using a Perl array,
fulfilling these requirements is trivial.  Perl auto-extends its arrays,
and initializes the element values, on every read or write.  For the C
programmer, things are not quite so easy.

   In this section, we will assume a C90 or C99 standard-conformant C
application.  This assumption is convenient on two grounds.  First,
this will be the intended use for many readers.  Second,
standard-conformant C is a "worst case".  Any issue faced by a
programmer of another environment is likely to also be one that must be
solved by the C programmer.

   Libmarpa often optimizes away unnecessary stack writes to stack
locations.  When it does so, it will not necessarily optimize away all
reads to that stack location.  This means that a location's first
access, as suggested by the Libmarpa step instructions, may be a read.
This possibility requires a special awareness from the C programmer, as
discussed in the sections *note Sizing the stack:: and *note
Initializing locations in the stack::.

   In the discussions in this document, stack locations are
non-negative integers.  The bottom of the stack is location 0.  In
moving from the bottom of the stack to the top, the numbers increase.
Stack location Y is said to be "greater" than stack location X if stack
location Y is closer to the top of stack than location X, and therefore
stack locations are considered greater or lesser if the integers that
represent them are greater or lesser.  Another way to state that a
stack location Y is greater (lesser) than stack location X is to say
that a stack location Y is later (earlier) than stack location X.

* Initializing locations in the stack::


File: api.info,  Node: Sizing the stack,  Next: Initializing locations in the stack,  Prev: Maintaining the stack,  Up: Maintaining the stack

17.4.1 Sizing the stack
-----------------------

If an implementation applies Libmarpa's step instructions literally,
using a physical stack, it must make sure the stack is large enough.
Specifically, the application must do the following

   * Ensure location 0 exists -- in other words that the stack is at
     least length 1.

   * For `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN' steps, ensure that location
     `marpa_v_result(v)' exists.

   * For `MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL' steps, ensure that location
     `marpa_v_result(v)' exists.

   * For `MARPA_STEP_RULE' steps, ensure that stack locations from
     `marpa_v_arg_0(v)' to `marpa_v_arg_n(v)' exist.

   Three aspects of these requirements deserve special mention.  First,
note that the requirement for a `MARPA_STEP_RULE' is that the
application size the stack to include the arguments to be read.
Because stack writes may be optimized away, an application, when
reading, cannot assume that the stack was sized appropriately by a
prior write.  The first access to a new stack location may be a read.

   Second, note that there is no explicit requirement that the
application size the stack to include the location for the result of the
`MARPA_STEP_RULE' step.  An application is allowed to assume that
result will go into one of the locations that were read.

   Third, special note should be made of the requirement that location
0 exist.  By convention, the parse result resides in location 0 of the
stack.  But, because the start symbol may have unvalued status, an
application cannot assume that it will receive a Libmarpa step
instruction that either reads from or writes to location 0.


File: api.info,  Node: Initializing locations in the stack,  Prev: Sizing the stack,  Up: Maintaining the stack

17.4.2 Initializing locations in the stack
------------------------------------------

Write optimizations also creates issues for implementations which
require data to be initialized before reading.  Every fully
standard-conforming C application is such an implementation.  Both C90
and C99 allow "trap values", and therefore conforming applications must
be prepared for an uninitialized location to contain one of those.
Reading a trap value may cause an abend.  (It is safe, in
standard-conforming C, to write to a location containing a trap value.)

   The requirement that locations be initialized before reading occurs
in other implementations.  Uninitialized locations will correspond to
unvalued symbols, but an implementation may require even "unvalued"
symbols to have a value that belongs to its "universe" of values.  A
symbol is "unvalued" if it does not have a predictable *specific* value.
For example, an application may be implemented expecting every item on
the stack to belong to a class, in which case the set of all objects of
that class would be that application's "universe" of values.  In such
an implementation, just as in standard-conformant C, every stack
location would need to be initialized before being read.

   Due to write optimizations, an application cannot rely on Libmarpa's
step instructions to initialize every stack location before its first
read.  One way to safely deal with the initialization of stack
locations, is to do all of the following:
   * When starting evaluation, ensure that the stack contains at least
     location 0.

   * Also, when starting evaluation, initialize every location in the
     stack.

   * Whenever the stack is extended, initialize every stack location
     added.

   Applications which try to optimize out some of these initializations
need to be aware that an application can never assume that activity in
the stack is safely "beyond" an uninitialized location.  Libmarpa steps
often revisit earlier sections of the stack, and these revisits may
include reads of previously unvisited stack locations.

17.5 Creating a new valuator
============================

 -- Function: Marpa_Value marpa_v_new ( Marpa_Tree T )
     Creates a new valuator.  The parent object of the new valuator
     will be the tree iterator T, and the reference count of the new
     valuator will be 1.  The reference count of T is increased by 1.

     The parent tree iterator is "paused", so that the tree iterator
     cannot move on to a new parse tree until the valuator is destroyed.
     Many valuators of the same parse tree can exist at once.  A tree
     iterator is "unpaused" when all of the valuators of that tree
     iterator are destroyed.

     Return value:  On success, the newly created valuator.  On
     failure, `NULL'.

17.6 Reference counting
=======================

 -- Function: Marpa_Value marpa_v_ref (Marpa_Value V)
     Increases the reference count by 1.  Not needed by most
     applications.

     Return value: On success, V.  On failure, `NULL'.

 -- Function: void marpa_v_unref ( Marpa_Value V)
     Decreases the reference count by 1, destroying V once the
     reference count reaches zero.  Beginning with V's parent tree,
     Libmarpa then proceeds up the chain of parent objects.  Every time
     a child is destroyed, the reference count of its parent is
     decreased by 1.  Every time the reference count of an object is
     decreased by 1, if that reference count is now zero, that object
     is destroyed.  Libmarpa follows this chain of decrements and
     destructions as required, all the way back to the base grammar, if
     necessary.

17.7 Registering semantics
==========================

 -- Function: int marpa_v_symbol_is_valued ( Marpa_Value V,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID )
 -- Function: int marpa_v_symbol_is_valued_set ( Marpa_Value V,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID, int VALUE )
     These methods, respectively, discover and set to VALUE, the valued
     status for symbol SYM_ID.  A valued status of 1 indicates that the
     symbol is valued.  A valued status of 0 indicates that the symbol
     is unvalued.  If the valued status is locked, an attempt to change
     to a status different from the current one will fail (error code
     `MARPA_ERR_VALUED_IS_LOCKED').

     Return value:  On success, the valued status *after* the call.  If
     VALUE is not either 0 or 1, or on other failure, -2.

 -- Function: int marpa_v_rule_is_valued ( Marpa_Value V, Marpa_Rule_ID
          RULE_ID )
 -- Function: int marpa_v_rule_is_valued_set ( Marpa_Value V,
          Marpa_Rule_ID RULE_ID, int VALUE )
     These methods respectively, discover and set to VALUE, the valued
     status for the LHS symbol of rule RULE_ID.  A valued status of 1
     indicates that the symbol is valued.  A valued status of 0
     indicates that the symbol is unvalued.  If the valued status is
     locked, an attempt to change to a status different from the
     current one will fail (error code `MARPA_ERR_VALUED_IS_LOCKED').

     Rules have no valued status of their own.  The valued status of a
     rule is always that of its LHS symbol.  These methods are
     conveniences -- they save the application the trouble of looking
     up the rule's LHS.

     Return value:  On success, the valued status of the rule RULE_ID's
     LHS symbol *after* the call.  If VALUE is not either 0 or 1, or on
     other failure, -2.

17.8 Stepping through the valuator
==================================

 -- Function: Marpa_Step_Type marpa_v_step ( Marpa_Value V)
     This method "steps through" the valuator.  The return value is a
     `Marpa_Step_Type', an integer which indicates the type of step.
     How the application is expected to act on each step is described
     below.  *Note Valuator steps by type::.  When the iteration
     through the steps is finished, `marpa_v_step' returns
     `MARPA_STEP_INACTIVE'.

     Return value:  On success, the type of the step to be performed.
     This will always be a non-negative number.  On failure, -2.

17.9 Valuator steps by type
===========================

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_RULE
     The semantics of a rule should be performed.  The application can
     find the value of the rule's children in the stack locations from
     `marpa_v_arg_0(v)' to `marpa_v_arg_n(v)'.  The semantics for the
     rule whose ID is `marpa_v_rule(v)' should be executed on these
     child values, and the result placed in `marpa_v_result(v)'.  The
     stack location of `marpa_v_result(v)' is guaranteed to be equal to
     `marpa_v_arg_0(v)'.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_TOKEN
     The semantics of a non-null token should be performed.  The
     application's value for the token whose ID is `marpa_v_token(v)'
     should be placed in stack location `marpa_v_result(v)'.  Its value
     according to Libmarpa will be in `marpa_v_token_value(v)'.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL
     The semantics for a nulling symbol should be performed.  The ID of
     the symbol is `marpa_v_symbol(v)' and its value should be placed in
     stack location `marpa_v_result(v)'.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_INACTIVE
     The valuator has gone through all of its steps and is now inactive.
     The value of the parse will be in stack location 0.  Because of
     unvalued symbols, it is quite possible for valuator to immediately
     became inactive -- `MARPA_STEP_INACTIVE' could be both the first
     and last step.


 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_INITIAL
     The valuator is new and has yet to go through any steps.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_INTERNAL1
 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_INTERNAL2
 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type MARPA_STEP_TRACE
     These step types are reserved for internal purposes.

17.10 Basic step accessors
==========================

The basic step accessors are so called because their information is
basic to the stack manipulation.  The basic step accessors are
implemented as macros.  They always succeed.

 -- Macro: int marpa_v_arg_0 (Marpa_Value V)
     For a `MARPA_STEP_RULE' step, returns the stack location where the
     value of first child can be found.  The value is always the same
     as that for the `marpa_v_result()' macro.

 -- Macro: int marpa_v_arg_n (Marpa_Value V)
     For a `MARPA_STEP_RULE' step, returns the stack location where the
     value of the last child can be found.

 -- Macro: int marpa_v_result (Marpa_Value V)
     Return the stack location where the result of the semantics should
     be placed.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Rule_ID marpa_v_rule (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: Returns the ID of the rule token for the
     `MARPA_STEP_RULE' step.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Step_Type marpa_v_step_type (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: Returns the current step type: `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN',
     `MARPA_STEP_RULE', etc.  Usually not needed since this is also the
     return value of `marpa_v_step()'.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_v_symbol (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: Returns the ID of the symbol for the
     `MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL' step.  The value is always the same as
     that for the `marpa_v_token()' macro.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Symbol_ID marpa_v_token (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: Returns the ID of the token for the
     `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN' step.

 -- Macro: void* marpa_v_token_value (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: Returns the integer which is (or which represents)
     the value of the token for the `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN' step.

17.11 Other step accessors
==========================

This section contains the step accessors that are not basic to stack
manipulation, but which provide other useful information about the
parse.  These step accessors are implemented as macros.

   All of these accessors always succeed, but if called when they are
irrelevant they return an unspecified value.  In this context, an
"unspecified value" is a value that is either -1 or the ID of a valid
Earley set, but which is otherwise unpredictable.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_es_id (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: If the current step type is `MARPA_STEP_RULE', the
     Earley Set ordinal where the rule ends.  If the current step type
     is `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN' or `MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL', the Earley
     Set ordinal where the symbol ends.  If the current step type is
     anything else, an unspecified value.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_rule_start_es_id (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: If the current step type is `MARPA_STEP_RULE', the
     Earley Set ordinal where the rule begins.  If the current step
     type is anything else, an unspecified value.

 -- Macro: Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_token_start_es_id (Marpa_Value V)
     Return value: If the current step type is `MARPA_STEP_TOKEN' or
     `MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL', the Earley Set ordinal where the
     token begins.  If the current step type is anything else, an
     unspecified value.

18.1 Overview
=============

Events are generated by the `marpa_g_precompute()',
`marpa_r_earleme_complete()', and `marpa_r_start_input()' methods.  The
methods are called event-active.  Event-active methods always clear all
previous events, so that after an event-active method the only events
available will be those generated by that method.

   Events are volatile, and it is expected that events will be queried
immediately after the method that generated them.  Note especially that
multiple recognizers using the same base grammar overwrite each other's
events.

   To find out how many events were generated by the last event-active
method, use the `marpa_g_event_count' method.

   To query a specific event, use the `marpa_g_event' and
`marpa_g_event_value' methods.

18.2 Methods
============

 -- Function: Marpa_Event_Type marpa_g_event (Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Event* EVENT, int IX)
     On success, the type of the IX'th event is returned and the data
     for the IX'th event is placed in the location pointed to by EVENT.

     Event indexes are in sequence.  Valid events will be in the range
     from 0 to N, where N is one less than the event count.  The event
     count can be queried using the `marpa_g_event_count()' method.

     Return value:  On success, the type of event IX.  If there is no
     IX'th event, if IX is negative, or on other failure, -2.  On
     failure, the locations pointed to by EVENT are not changed.

 -- Function: int marpa_g_event_count ( Marpa_Grammar g )
     Return value:  On success, the number of events.  On failure, -2.

 -- Macro: int marpa_g_event_value (Marpa_Event* EVENT)
     This macro provides access to the "value" of the event.  The
     semantics of the value varies according to the type of the event,

     Suggested message: "No event".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE
     A nullable symbol is either the separator for, or the right hand
     side of, a sequence.  Event value: The ID of the symbol.
     Suggested message: "This symbol is a counted nullable".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD
     The user-settable Earley item threshold was exceeded.  Event
     value: Undefined.  Suggested message: "Too many Earley items".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED
     The parse is exhausted.  Event value: Undefined.  Suggested
     message: "Recognizer is exhausted".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES
     One or more rules are loop rules -- rules that are part of a cycle.
     Cycles are pathological cases of recursion, in which the same
     symbol string derives itself a potentially infinite number of
     times.  Nonetheless, Marpa parses in the presence of these, and it
     is up to the application to treat these as fatal errors, something
     they almost always will wish to do.  Event value: The count of
     loop rules.  Suggested message: "Grammar contains a infinite loop".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL
     A nulling symbol is also a terminal.  Event value: The ID of the
     symbol.  Suggested message: "This symbol is a nulling terminal".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_EXPECTED
     The recognizer can be set to generate an events when a symbol is
     expected using its `marpa_r_expected_symbol_event_set()' method.

19.1 Error methods
==================

 -- Function: Marpa_Error_Code marpa_g_error ( Marpa_Grammar G, const
          char** P_ERROR_STRING)
     When a method fails, this method allows the application to read
     the error code.  P_ERROR_STRING is reserved for use by the
     internals.  Applications should set it to `NULL'.

     Return value: The last error code from a Libmarpa method.  Always
     succeeds.

 -- Function: Marpa_Error_Code marpa_g_error_clear ( Marpa_Grammar G )
     Sets the error code to `MARPA_ERR_NONE'.  Not often used, but now

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERRCODE_COUNT

19.3 External error codes
=========================

This section lists the external error codes.  These are the only error
codes that users of the Libmarpa external interface should ever see.
Internal error codes are in their own section.  *Note Internal error
codes::.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NONE
     No error condition.  The error code is initialized to this value.
     Methods which do not result in failure sometimes reset the error
     code to `MARPA_ERR_NONE'.  Numeric value: 0.  Suggested message:
     "No error".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_BAD_SEPARATOR
     A separator was specified for a sequence rule, but its ID was not
     that of a valid symbol.  Numeric value: 6.  Suggested message:
     "Separator has invalid symbol ID".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_BEFORE_FIRST_TREE
     A tree iterator is positioned before the first tree, and it was
     specified in a context where that is not allowed.  A newly created
     tree is positioned before the first tree.  To position a newly
     created tree iterator to the first tree use the `marpa_t_next()'
     method.  Numeric value: 91.  Suggested message: "Tree iterator is
     before first tree".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE
     A "counted" symbol was found that is also a nullable symbol.  A
     "counted" symbol is one that appears on the RHS of a sequence rule.
     If a symbol is nullable, counting its occurrences becomes
     difficult.  Questions of definition and problems of implementation
     arise.  At a minimum, a sequence with counted nullables would be
     wildly ambigious.

     Sequence rules are simply an optimized shorthand for rules that
     can also be written in ordinary BNF.  If the equivalent of a
     sequence of nullables is really what your application needs,
     nothing in Libmarpa prevents you from specifying that sequence
     with ordinary BNF rules.

     Numeric value: 8.  Suggested message: "Nullable symbol on RHS of a
     sequence rule".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_RULE
     This error indicates an attempt to add a BNF rule which is a
     duplicate of a BNF rule already in the grammar.  Two BNF rules are
     considered duplicates if

        * Both rules have the same left hand symbol, and

        * Both rules have the same right hand symbols in the same order.

     Duplication of sequence rules, and duplication between BNF rules
     and sequence rules, is dealt with by requiring that the LHS of a
     sequence rule not be the LHS of any other rule.

     Numeric value: 11.  Suggested message: "Duplicate rule".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_TOKEN
     This error indicates an attempt to add a duplicate token.  A token
     is a duplicate if one already read at the same earleme has the
     same symbol ID and the same length.  Numeric value: 12.  Suggested
     message: "Duplicate token".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_EIM_COUNT
     This error code indicates that an implementation-defined limit on
     the number of Earley items per Earley set was exceedeed.  This
     limit is different from the Earley item warning threshold, an
     optional limit on the number of Earley items in an Earley set,
     which can be set by the application.

     The implementation defined-limit is very large, at least
     500,000,000 earlemes.  An application is unlikely ever to see this
     error.  Libmarpa's use of memory would almost certainly exceed the
     implementation's limits before it occurred.  Numeric value: 13.
     Suggested message: "Maximum number of Earley items exceeded".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_EVENT_IX_NEGATIVE
     A negative event index was specified.  That is not allowed.
     Numeric value: 15.  Suggested message: "Negative event index".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_EVENT_IX_OOB
     An non-negative event index was specified, but there is no event
     at that index.  Since the events are in sequence, this means it
     was too large.  Numeric value: 16.  Suggested message: "No event
     at that index".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_I_AM_NOT_OK
     The Libmarpa base grammar is in a "not ok" state.  Currently, the
     only way this can happen is if Libmarpa memory is being
     overwritten.  Numeric value: 29.  Suggested message: "Marpa is in
     a not OK state".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE
     The grammar has a cycle -- one or more loop rules.  This is a
     recoverable error, although most applications will want to treat
     it as fatal.  For more see the description of *note
     marpa_g_precompute::.  Numeric value: 17.  Suggested message:
     "Grammar has cycle".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INACCESSIBLE_TOKEN
     This error code indicates that indicates that the token symbol is
     an inaccessible symbol -- one which cannot be reached from the
     start symbol.

     Since the inaccessibility of a symbol is a property of the grammar,
     this error code typically indicates an application error.
     Nevertheless, a retry at this location, using another token ID,
     may succeed.  At this writing, the author knows of no uses of this
     technique.

     Numeric value: 18.  Suggested message: "Token symbol is
     inaccessible".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_BOOLEAN
     A function was called that takes a boolean argument, but the value
     of that argument was not either 0 or 1.  Numeric value: 22.
     Suggested message: "Argument is not boolean".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION
     The location (Earley set ID) is not valid.  It may be invalid for
     one of two reasons:
        * It is negative, and it is being used as the argument to a
          method for which that negative value does not have a special
          meaning.

        * It is after the latest Earley set.

     For users of input models other than the standard one, the term
     "location", as used in association with this error code, means
     Earley set ID or Earley set ordinal.  In the standard input model,
     this will always be identical with Libmarpa's other idea of
     location, the earleme.

     Numeric value: 25.  Suggested message: "Location is not valid".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_START_SYMBOL
     A start symbol was specified, but its symbol ID is not that of a
     valid symbol.  Numeric value: 27.  Suggested message: "Specified
     start symbol is not valid".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_RULE_ID
     A method was called with an invalid rule ID.  This is a rule ID
     which not only does not exist, but cannot exist.  Currently that
     means its value is less than zero.  Numeric value: 26.  Suggested
     message: "Rule ID is malformed".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_SYMBOL_ID
     A method was called with an invalid symbol ID.  This is a symbol
     ID which not only does not exist, but cannot exist.  Currently
     that means its value is less than zero.  Numeric value: 28.
     Suggested message: "Symbol ID is malformed".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_MAJOR_VERSION_MISMATCH
     There was a mismatch in the major version number between the
     requested version of libmarpa, and the actual one.  Numeric value:
     30.  Suggested message: "Libmarpa major version number is a
     mismatch".


 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_MICRO_VERSION_MISMATCH
     There was a mismatch in the micro version number between the
     requested version of libmarpa, and the actual one.  Numeric value:
     31.  Suggested message: "Libmarpa micro version number is a
     mismatch".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_MINOR_VERSION_MISMATCH
     There was a mismatch in the minor version number between the
     requested version of libmarpa, and the actual one.  Numeric value:
     32.  Suggested message: "Libmarpa minor version number is a
     mismatch".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION
     A non-negative Earley set ID (also called an Earley set ordinal)
     was specified, but there is no corresponding Earley set.  Since
     the Earley set ordinals are in sequence, this means that the
     specified ID is greater than that of the latest Earley set.
     Numeric value: 39.  Suggested message: "Earley set ID is after
     latest Earley set".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NOT_PRECOMPUTED
     The grammar is not precomputed, and attempt was made to do
     something with it that is not allowed for unprecomputed grammars.
     For example, a recognizer cannot be created from a grammar until
     it is precomputed.  Numeric value: 34.  Suggested message: "This
     grammar is not precomputed".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_PARSE
     The application attempted to create a bocage from a recognizer
     without a parse.  Applications will often want to treat this as a
     soft error.  Numeric value: 41.  Suggested message: "No parse".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_RULES
     A grammar which has no rules is being used in a way that is not
     allowed.  Usually the problem is that the user is trying to
     precompute the grammar.  Numeric value: 42.  Suggested message:
     "This grammar does not have any rules".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_START_SYMBOL
     The grammar has no start symbol, and an attempt was made to
     perform an operation which requires one.  Usually the problem is
     that the user is trying to precompute the grammar.  Numeric value:
     43.  Suggested message: "This grammar has no start symbol".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_SUCH_RULE_ID
     A method was called with a rule ID which is well-formed, but the
     rule does not exist.  Numeric value: 89.  Suggested message: "No
     rule with this ID exists".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_SUCH_SYMBOL_ID
     A method was called with a symbol ID which is well-formed, but the
     symbol does not exist.  Numeric value: 90.  Suggested message: "No
     symbol with this ID exists".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NO_TOKEN_EXPECTED_HERE
     This error code indicates that no tokens at all were expected at
     this earleme location.  This can only happen in alternative input
     models.

     Typically, this indicates an application programming error.
     Retrying input at this location will always fail.  But if the
     application is able to leave this earleme empty, a retry at a
     later location, using this or another token, may succeed.  At this
     writing, the author knows of no uses of this technique.

     Numeric value: 44.  Suggested message: "No token is expected at
     this earleme location".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL
     Marpa does not allow a symbol to be both nulling and a terminal.
     Numeric value: 49.  Suggested message: "A symbol is both terminal
     and nulling".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_ORDER_FROZEN
     The Marpa order object has been frozen.  If a Marpa order object
     is frozen, it cannot be changed.

     Multiple tree iterators can share a Marpa order object, but that
     order object is frozen after the first tree iterator is created
     from it.  Applications can order an bocage in many ways, but they
     must do so by creating multiple order objects.

     Numeric value: 50.  Suggested message: "The ordering is frozen".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED
     The parse is exhausted.  Numeric value: 53.  Suggested message:
     "The parse is exhausted".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_PARSE_TOO_LONG
     The parse is too long.  The limit on the length of a parse is
     implementation dependent, but it is very large, at least
     500,000,000 earlemes.

     This error code is unlikely in the standard input model.  Almost
     certainly memory would be exceeded before it could occur.  If an
     application sees this error, it almost certainly using one of the
     non-standard input models.

     Most often this messsage will occur because of a request to add a
     single extremely long token, perhaps as a result of an application
     error.  But it is also possible this error condition will occur
     after the input of a large number of long tokens.

     Numeric value: 54.  Suggested message: "This input would make the
     parse too long".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_POINTER_ARG_NULL
     In a method which takes pointers as arguments, one of the pointer
     arguments is `NULL', in a case where that is not allowed.  One
     such method is `marpa_r_progress_item()'.  Numeric value: 56.
     Suggested message: "An argument is null when it should not be".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_PRECOMPUTED
     An attempt was made to use a precomputed grammar in a way that is
     not allowed.  Often this is an attempt to change the grammar.
     Nearly every change to a grammar after precomputation invalidates
     the precomputation, and is therefore not allowed.  Numeric value:
     57.  Suggested message: "This grammar is precomputed".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_NOT_STARTED
     No recognizer progress report is currently active, and an action
     has been attempted which is inconsistent with that.  One such
     action would be a `marpa_r_progress_item()' call.  Numeric value:
     59.  Suggested message: "No progress report has been started".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_EXHAUSTED
     The progress report is "exhausted" -- all its items have been
     iterated through.  Numeric value: 58.  Suggested message: "The
     progress report is exhausted".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RANK_TOO_LOW
     A symbol or rule rank was specified which was less than an
     implementation-defined minimum.  Implementations will always allow
     at least those ranks in the range between -134,217,727 and
     134,217,727.  Numeric value: 85.  Suggested message: "Rule or
     symbol rank too low".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RANK_TOO_HIGH
     A symbol or rule rank was specified which was greater than an
     implementation-defined maximum.  Implementations will always allow
     at least those ranks in the range between -134,217,727 and
     134,217,727.  Numeric value: 86.  Suggested message: "Rule or
     symbol rank too high".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RECCE_NOT_ACCEPTING_INPUT
     The recognizer is not accepting input, and the application has
     attempted something that is inconsistent with that fact.  Numeric
     value: 60.  Suggested message: "The recognizer is not accepting
     input".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RECCE_NOT_STARTED
     The recognizer has not been started.  and the application has
     attempted something that is inconsistent with that fact.  Numeric
     value: 61.  Suggested message: "The recognizer has not been
     started".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RECCE_STARTED
     The recognizer has been started.  and the application has
     attempted something that is inconsistent with that fact.  Numeric
     value: 62.  Suggested message: "The recognizer has been started".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RHS_IX_NEGATIVE
     The index of a RHS symbol was specified, and it was negative.
     That is not allowed.  Numeric value: 63.  Suggested message: "RHS
     index cannot be negative".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RHS_IX_OOB
     A non-negative index of RHS symbol was specified, but there is no
     symbol at that index.  Since the indexes are in sequence, this
     means the index was greater than or equal to the rule length.
     Numeric value: 64.  Suggested message: "RHS index must be less
     than rule length".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_RHS_TOO_LONG
     An attempt was made to add a rule with too many right hand side
     symbols.  The limit on the RHS symbol count is implementation
     dependent, but it is very large, at least 500,000,000 symbols.
     This is far beyond what is required in any current practical
     grammar.  An application with rules of this length is almost
     certain to run into memory and other limits.  Numeric value: 65.
     Suggested message: "The RHS is too long".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE
     The LHS of a sequence rule cannot be the LHS of any other rule,
     whether a sequence rule or a BNF rule.  An attempt was made to
     violate this restriction.  Numeric value: 66.  Suggested message:
     "LHS of sequence rule would not be unique".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_START_NOT_LHS
     The start symbol is not on the LHS on any rule.  That means it
     could never match any possible input, not even the null string.
     Presumably, an error in writing the grammar.  Numeric value: 73.
     Suggested message: "Start symbol not on LHS of any rule".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_VALUED_CONFLICT
     An unvalued symbol may take on any value, and therefore a symbol
     which is unvalued at some points cannot safely to be used to
     contain a value at others.  This error indicates that such an
     unsafe use is being attempted.  Numeric value: 74.  Suggested
     message: "Symbol is treated both as valued and unvalued".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TERMINAL_IS_LOCKED
     An attempt was made to change the terminal status of a symbol to a
     different value after it was locked.  Numeric value: 75.
     Suggested message: "The terminal status of the symbol is locked".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TOKEN_IS_NOT_TERMINAL
     A token was specified whose symbol ID is not a terminal.  Numeric
     value: 76.  Suggested message: "Token symbol must be a terminal".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TOKEN_LENGTH_LE_ZERO
     A token length was specified which is less than or equal to zero.
     Zero-length tokens are not allowed in Libmarpa.  Numeric value: 77.
     Suggested message: "Token length must greater than zero".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TOKEN_TOO_LONG
     The token length is too long.  The limit on the length of a token
     is implementation dependent, but it is at least 500,000,000
     earlemes.  An application using a token that long is almost
     certain to run into some other limit.  Numeric value: 78.
     Suggested message: "Token is too long".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TREE_EXHAUSTED
     A Libmarpa parse tree iterator is "exhausted", that is, it has no
     more parses.  Numeric value: 79.  Suggested message: "Tree
     iterator is exhausted".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_TREE_PAUSED
     A Libmarpa tree is "paused" and an operation was attempted which
     is inconsistent with that fact.  Typically, this operation will be
     a call of the `marpa_t_next()' method.  Numeric value: 80.
     Suggested message: "Tree iterator is paused".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID
     An attempt was made to read a token where a token with that symbol
     ID is not expected.  This message can also occur when an attempt
     is made to read a token at a location where no token is expected.
     Numeric value: 81.  Suggested message: "Unexpected token".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_UNPRODUCTIVE_START
     The start symbol is unproductive.  That means it could never match
     any possible input, not even the null string.  Presumably, an
     error in writing the grammar.  Numeric value: 82.  Suggested
     message: "Unproductive start symbol".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_VALUATOR_INACTIVE
     The valuator is inactive in a context where that should not be the
     case.  Numeric value: 83.  Suggested message: "Valuator inactive".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_VALUED_IS_LOCKED
     The valued status of a symbol is locked, and an attempt was made
     to change it to a status different from the current one.  Numeric
     value: 84.  Suggested message: "The valued status of the symbol is
     locked".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_IS_NULLING
     An attempt was made to do something with a nulling symbol that is
     not allowed.  For example, the ID of a nulling symbol cannot be an
     argument to `marpa_r_expected_symbol_event_set' -- because it is
     not possible to create an "expected symbol" event for a nulling
     symbol.  Numeric value: 87.  Suggested message: "Symbol is
     nulling".

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_IS_UNUSED
     An attempt was made to do something with a nulling symbol that is
     not allowed.  An "unused" symbol is a inaccessible or unproductive
     symbol.  For example, the ID of a unused symbol cannot be an
     argument to `marpa_r_expected_symbol_event_set' -- because it is
     not possible to create an "expected symbol" event for a nulling
     symbol.  Numeric value: 88.  Suggested message: "Symbol is not
     used".

19.4 Internal error codes
=========================

An internal error code may be one of two things: First, it can be an
error code which arises from an internal Libmarpa programming issue (in
other words, something happening in the code that was not supposed to
be able to happen.)  Second, it can be an error code which only occurs
when a method from Libmarpa's internal interface is used.  Both kinds
of internal error message share one common trait -- users of the
Libmarpa's external interface should never see them.

   Internal error messages require someone with knowledge of the
Libmarpa internals to follow up on them.  They usually do not have
descriptions or suggested messages.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_AHFA_IX_NEGATIVE
     Numeric value: 1.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_AHFA_IX_OOB
     Numeric value: 2.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_ANDID_NEGATIVE

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_ANDIX_NEGATIVE
     Numeric value: 5.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_BOCAGE_ITERATION_EXHAUSTED
     Numeric value: 7.

 -- Macro: int MARPA_ERR_DEVELOPMENT
     "Development" errors were used heavily during Libmarpa's
     development, when it was not yet clear how precisely to classify
     every error condition.  Unless they are using a developer's
     version, users of the external interface should never see
     development errors.

     Development errors has an error string associated with them.  The
     error string is a short 7-bit ASCII error string which describes
     the error.  Numeric value: 9.  Suggested message: "Development
     error, see string".

File: api.info,  Node: Why so many time objects,  Next: Design of numbered objects,  Prev: Design notes,  Up: Design notes

20.1 Why so many time objects?
==============================

Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.  Marpa achieves its
efficiency, not in spite of making multiple passes over the data, but
because of it.  Marpa regularly substitutes two fast O(N) passes for a
single O(N log N) pass.  Marpa's proliferation of time objects is in
keeping with its multi-pass approach.

   Bocage objects come at no cost, even for unambiguous parses, because
the same pass which creates the bocage also deals with other issues
which are of major significance for unambiguous parses.  It is the
post-processing of the bocage pass that enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.

   Of the various objects, the best case for elimination is of the
ordering object.  In many cases, the ordering is trivial.  Either the
parse is unambiguous, or the application does not care about the order
in which parses are returned.  But while it would be easy to add an
option to bypass creation of an ordering object, there is little to be
gained from it.  When the ordering is trivial, its overhead is very
small -- essentially a handful of subroutine calls.  Many orderings
accomplish nothing, but these cost next to nothing.

   Tree objects come at minimal cost to unambiguous grammars, because
the same pass that allows iteration through multiple parse trees does
the tree traversal.  This eliminates much of the work that otherwise
would need to be done in the valuation time object.  In the current
implement, the valuation time object needs only to step through a
sequence already determined in the tree iterator.


File: api.info,  Node: Design of numbered objects,  Next: LHS Terminals,  Prev: Why so many time objects,  Up: Design notes

20.2 Numbered objects
=====================

As the name suggests, the choice was made to implement numbered objects
as integers, and not as pointers.  In standard-conformant C, integers
can be safely checked for validity, while pointers cannot.

   There are efficiency tradeoffs between pointers and integers but
they are complicated, and they go both ways.  Pointers can be faster,
but integers can be used as indexes into more than one data structure.
Which is actually faster depends on the design.  Integers allow for a
more flexible design, so that once the choice is settled on, careful
programming can make them a win, possibly a very big one.

   The approach taken in Libmarpa was to settle, from the outset, on
integers as the implementation for numbered objects, and to optimize on
that basis.  The author concedes that it is possible that others
redoing Libmarpa from scratch might find that pointers are faster.  But
the author is confident that they will also discover, on modern
architectures, that the lack of safe validity checking is far too high
a price to pay for the difference in speed.


File: api.info,  Node: LHS Terminals,  Prev: Design of numbered objects,  Up: Design notes

20.3 LHS terminals
==================

Marpa's idea in losing the sharp division between terminals and
non-terminals is that the distinction, while helpful for proving
theorems, is not essential in practice.  LHS symbols in the input might
be useful for "short circuiting" the rules in which they occur.  This
may prove helpful in debugging, or have other applications.

   However, it also can be useful, for checking input validity as well
as for efficiency, to follow tradition and distinguish non-terminals
from terminals.  For this reason, the traditional behavior is the
default in Libmarpa.

21.1 Untested methods
=====================

The methods of this section are not in the external interface, because
they have not been adequately tested.  Their fate is uncertain.  Users
should regard these methods as experimental and unsupported.

 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_default_rank ( Marpa_Grammar G)
 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_default_rank_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Rank RANK)
     These methods, respectively, set and query the default rank of the
     grammar.  When a grammar is created, the default rank is 0.  When
     rules and symbols are created, their rank is the default rank of
     the grammar.

     Changing the grammar's default rank does not affect those rules
     and symbols already created, only those that will be created.
     This means that the grammar's default rank can be used to, in
     effect, assign ranks to groups of rules and symbols.  Applications
     may find this behavior useful.

     Return value: On success, the rank *after* the call.  On failure,
     -2.


 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_symbol_rank ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID sym_id)
 -- Function: Marpa_Rank marpa_g_symbol_rank_set ( Marpa_Grammar G,
          Marpa_Symbol_ID SYM_ID, Marpa_Rank RANK)
     These methods, respectively, set and query the rank of a symbol
     SYM_ID.  When SYM_ID is created, its rank initialized to the
     default rank of the grammar.

     Return value: On success, the rank *after* the call.  If the
     grammar has been precomputed, or on other failure, -2.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
