# Marpa::R2 Updates

## About this page

This is the updates page for Marpa::R2.
On CPAN, Marpa::R2's primary distribution mechanism,
there is no way to have true "meta" information --
even a small doc always is part of the distribution itself
and requires a completely new version.

This page carries information which does not justify
a full new distribution,
but which it is useful for the user to know.
Because Marpa is now "stable", new versions are released only
when they benefit its current users.
In effect, this means new versions occur only when a serious
bug is discovered, which (knock on wood)
so far has happened rarely.
