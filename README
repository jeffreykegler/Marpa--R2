This is a working repository for RELEASE 2 of the Marpa.

NOTICE to CONTRIBUTORS: Marpa::R2 is not completely frozen, but it is
largely closed to new features.  In making exceptions, the welfare of
the current application base is primary -- new features should be fully
compatible and to have a low-risk of introducing new problems.

Bug fixes to Marpa::R2 are welcome, and get the Marpa projects highest
priority.

If you want to work on a new feature, it is best to ask before investing
a lot of time or effort into it.

Contributing to Marpa::R2
=========================

This is the repository for Marpa::R2, release 2 of the Marpa Perl
module.

By submitting code to this repository, you are considered to have
signed off on the Developer's Certificate of Origin, which is given
below.

All code contributed must be compatible with version 3 of the Lesser
GNU General Public License (LGPLv3), which is the license covering
the Marpa::R2 distribution as a whole.

Copyright assignments are not required (or requested). All code
retains its original ownership.  One implication of this ownership
structure is that any attempt to change the licensing will require
the agreement of all copyright holders.  As a practical matter,
this means that it will soon become impractical to change the
license.

It is imperative that all contributed code be legitimately free
software.  For that reason, code from anonymous (or pseudonymous)
contributors will not be accepted.  By contributing code to this
repository, all contributors "sign off" on that code, agreeing that
the code can be distributed under the LGPL.  Code which has not
been licensed as free software by its owner, or which risks creating
copyright-related problems (such as code which derives from
reverse-engineering efforts lacking proper safeguards) cannot be
contributed.
